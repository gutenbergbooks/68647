<h2 class="nobreak" id="Preface">Preface</h2>

<p class="drop-capy">Quaint, old-time title pages sought to present
an epitome of the contents of the volume.
While the name of Dr. House occupies the
sole post of honour on this present title page, none
would be more urgent than he to have that place
shared by his wife, Harriet Pettit House, and her
assistant, Arabella Anderson-Noyes, and by their godson,
Boon Itt, whose achievements occupy a good
share of the pages that follow.</p>

<p>The essential material in this book has been drawn
from the letters and journal of Dr. House, now for
the first time available for the purpose. This material
has been supplemented by correspondence with
various individuals connected with the principal persons
mentioned. The facts thus ascertained have been
interpreted and amplified by the careful reading of
nearly every book in English on Siamese subjects.
For this reason, the narrative may claim to be fairly
complete and authentic.</p>

<p>Two reasons have prompted publication. One reason
is to make accessible valuable historical materials.
In the archives of the Presbyterian Board of Foreign
Missions no records covering this period have been
found other than the meagre references in the annual
reports of the Board. The diary of Dr. House’s co-worker,
Rev. Stephen Mattoon, was destroyed by fire;
and, so far as is known, no other private records for
those early years are in existence. The only primary
source of information is the chapter, “History of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
Missions in Siam,” from the pen of Dr. House, in the
volume <cite>Siam and Laos</cite>, in which his modesty has obscured
the importance of his own labours. So this
book is offered as a contribution to the history of the
Church in Siam.</p>

<p>The other reason is that the Church is entitled to
the stimulus of the heroic examples of these godly
people. Biographies, at best, do not appeal to a large
circle of readers. Missionary biographies appeal to
fewer still. However, a book that stimulates a few
hundred workers in the vineyard of the Lord may
effect more good in the long run than a book of great
but passing popularity. I venture to believe that few
will read the record of the life-work of Dr. and Mrs.
House and the brief story of Boon Itt without being
quickened by the example of their persistent faith,
buoyant hopefulness, sublime trust and apostolic
devotion.</p>

<p>Not the least worth while do I count it to be able to
place this narrative in the hands of the young Church
of Siam that she may transmit to the rising generation
the story of “<span class="smcap">The Man With the Gentle Heart</span>.”</p>

<p>I acknowledge with appreciation the hearty encouragement
of friends to publish what my own
inclination would have allowed to remain in private
manuscript. Also, I gladly state that publication
would not have been possible without the financial
assistance of friends who feel that the Church of
today should have the privilege of knowing these
noble characters, but who themselves prefer to remain
unnamed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I<br />A SUDDEN PLUNGE INTO WORK</h2>

<p class="drop-capy">Dr. Samuel R. House did not have time
nor need to “hang out a shingle” upon
reaching Bangkok. He had been there only
a few days—not long enough to unpack his goods—when
“a message came from some great man by
three trusty servants that a servant whom he loved
very much had got angry and had half cut his hand
off with a sword.”</p>

<p>This wound was not accidental but self-inflicted.
It was a perverted result of a Siamese custom. In
those days slavery prevailed in the country. Besides
the war-captives who were cast into slavery, custom
made it possible for any of the common people to be
sold into servitude. If a man failed to pay a debt
there were two alternatives before him, to be confined
in one of the horrible jails until he discharged his
obligation, or to sell himself or his wife or children
into slavery to remain in that state until the accumulated
value of the services should cancel the debt.</p>

<p>Only too often these debts were the result of
gambling, a vice that was universally prevalent under
license of the government. If the debtor was fortunate
enough, he might sell the chosen victim to some
lord who was willing to accept the services in pledge
for a loan with which to pay the actual creditor.
Such an arrangement was not altogether without its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
advantages, for many an improvident spendthrift had
a comfortable living for himself and family assured
by the better management of his lord. But once in
servitude the victim was likely to be held in peonage
indefinitely, because usury on the loan was liable to
mount up faster than the value of services rendered.</p>

<p>It will readily be imagined that a man so improvident
as to permit himself to fall into slavery would
not be the most willing worker, and many would be
the tricks of the lazy man to labour as little as possible.
A rather common scheme to avoid an unpleasant
duty or merely to spite the over-lord was to go to
the extreme of inflicting upon self a wound that
would incapacitate from work. Such was the nature
of this first surgical case to which Dr. House
was called.</p>

<p>The readiness with which this great man summoned
a strange foreign doctor will be easily understood
when it is known that for twelve years previous there
had been an American physician in Bangkok. Since
1835 Rev. Daniel B. Bradley, M.D., representing the
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions
(A B C F M), had been practising medicine
and he had established a high reputation among all
classes for western medicine and surgery. On account
of the recent death of his wife, Dr. Bradley,
with his young children, had sailed for home only a
few weeks before the arrival of the new missionary.</p>

<p>When Dr. House set out for Siam he knew that
Dr. Bradley was there and, having had no practical
experience in his profession before leaving home, he
looked forward to beginning his labours in association
with one who not only was a skilled practitioner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
but who also knew the pathological conditions of the
Siamese. When, upon arrival, Dr. House discovered
that Dr. Bradley had withdrawn he felt some alarm
at the absence of professional counsel, for he had a
constitutional lack of self-confidence that caused him
to feel a painful burden of responsibility in prescribing
for patients. At the end of the first six months
he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Whatever seemed once likely to be my fate it is
pretty certain now that there is more danger of my
wearing out than of rusting out in this land. Have been
on the run or occupied with visitors all the day and
evening ... and my poor brain has, like its fellow
labourer the heart, been compelled to go through with a
great deal. What sights of human misery I am compelled
to see. And to feel that I have not the power of
skill to alleviate,—the iron enters my soul.”</p>
</div>

<p>Whatever may have been the first effect of being
compelled to enter upon his profession alone, it is
doubtful whether Dr. House ever perceived that this
constraint was probably one means by which he
gained the confidence of the Siamese within a very
short period. For instead of being regarded either as
a competitor or as an assistant to Dr. Bradley, he was
accepted at the outset upon the reputation which his
predecessor had so firmly established. It was this
repute of western medicine which caused the great
man to send so promptly for an unknown physician
to treat the self-mutilated servant.</p>

<p>Quickly it became known among the people of
Bangkok that another physician had arrived. The
calls for treatment came in such numbers and with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
such importunity that in self-defense it was deemed
wise to open the dispensary which had remained
closed since the departure of Dr. Bradley, although
there was only a limited supply of drugs on hand and
the nearest base of supplies was London. The dispensary,
or hospital as it was sometimes called, of
which Dr. House thus suddenly found himself the
proprietor and whole staff, was just one of the innumerable
floating houses which lined the river banks
of the Siamese capital. It is said that when this new
capital was being established the common people were
not allowed to build houses on land but permitted to
live only in boats. At any rate, until modern times
the larger portion of the population lived in floating
houses.</p>

<p>These houses are simply constructed. A raft of
bamboo forms the foundation, which is moored to the
bank or to poles driven into the mud. Upon that
foundation a one-story house of boards, thatched with
palm leaves, is built. The house is, customarily, divided
into three rooms. At either end, extending
clear across the floor is a kitchen and a common bedroom.
The space between is occupied by the common
living-room and a porch. The living-room is fully
open along the porch, from which it is separated by
the rise of a step. Closely packed together in irregular
rows, sometimes two or three deep, these houses
are ranged along the banks of the river and of the
many canals that form the Venetian highways of the
city. The channel beneath the houses, kept from
being stagnant by movement of the tide, served at
once as the sewer and the family bath. Many of
these houses are occupied as stores, with their merchandise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
exposed to the full view of the customer
who does his shopping in a boat.</p>

<p>It was such a house as this that served the missionary
as a hospital. But “hospital” is scarcely the
proper word to use judged from the equipment, which
consisted of a chair or two, a table for operations and
a few mats for the patients. But the place had one
great advantage—the open side exposed the work of
the foreign doctor to the gaze of the curious natives
who stopped while passing in their boats, and then
related to their friends the wonders they had seen.</p>

<p>Here in this rude native shelter, until he gave up
his profession, Dr. House applied himself with deep
devotion and self-abandon to relieving the physical
sufferings of the people. He placed himself wholly
at their service, and made no discrimination between
rank of those he served. Frequently he would not
reach the dinner table till the middle of the afternoon,
detained by the importuning patients; and he even
laments that the people would not summon him in the
night time in case of serious need.</p>


<h3>SOME TYPICAL CASES</h3>

<p>His record of patients, to one who is not familiar
with a physician’s records, gives astonishment at the
kind of cases which seemed to predominate. One
class was the ulcers and running sores—many of
them most aggravated. These usually were the result
of long-neglected wounds. He writes of extracting
bamboo splinters great and small that had become
imbedded in the flesh and remained there to produce
serious inflammation and infection. In such cases an
ignorance too dense for intelligence to comprehend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
was the contributory cause of untold suffering. A
second class of cases frequently appearing was that of
fresh wounds resulting from drunken brawls, street
fights, treachery and revenge, or self-mutilation.
Scarcely a week passed but a patient was brought in
with head cut open, face gashed, back lashed, or
some other gaping cut. But most loathsome of all
were the diseases which the doctor characterised as
the result of vices—diseases which found victims
among all sorts and conditions of men who “working
that which is unseemly” received “in themselves that
recompense of their errors which was meet.”</p>

<p>A cursory review of one day’s succession of patients
will be suggestive. Here returns a man with a
tumor on his ear, having the previous day been advised
to come for an operation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“With good courage and I believe without a trembling
hand, I sat down to this, my first operation not only in
the Kingdom of Siam, but the first operation I think I
ever undertook. It was a simple one, and oh, I cannot
but catch such a glimpse of my Father’s loving-kindness
in thus gently leading his poor ignorant by such
simpler cases into the confidence in myself necessary to
do the more serious cases which will doubtless fall to my
lot.... Believing that without His blessing the simplest
operation would fail and with it the most doubtful
one might prosper, I lifted up my heart a moment to
Him in whose name I had ventured to come among this
people to try to do them good.”</p>
</div>

<p>While attending him, a boat came up with two
women, one a loathsome object full of sores and
scabs—face, hands and limbs—the scars of former
ulcers. A Chinaman with a scrofulous neck—a lad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
with gastric derangement—a boy whose leg was
transfixed with a sharp piece of bamboo—so moves
the procession. As he returns late for dinner he
observes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“This morning was fully occupied till dinner at 2 p. m.,
trying to do the works of mercy—how could I send any
away empty! And oh, how happy I should have been in
such Christ-like works had I but knowledge of the diseases,
and judgment and skill. As it is now, the deciding
what is to be done with each case is an act of the mind
positively painful, because I am constantly fearing that
I may not follow the best possible plan.”</p>
</div>

<p>On another day thus reads the entry:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“On going down to the floating house at 9 a. m., found
several new patients. A Chinaman of fifty, with caries
of the lower jaw, skin of cheek adhering, pus has discharged
from a large cavity within the mouth. Another
Chinaman with syphilitic destruction of the bones of the
nose—a hole left in the flattened face where pus was
discharging.... He seemed to be in great torment—eaten
of worms literally. Now a mother brings a naked
child of five, having large ulcers and a lump on the
thigh, the sequel of the smallpox had two or three
months ago. A Chinaman brings the child of a friend;
poor lad, the smallpox had destroyed one eye and
blinded the other—so no hope, no remedy.”</p>
</div>


<h3>BUSY DAYS AND A BURDENED HEART</h3>

<p>The hours at the hospital were daily from early
morning, frequently from six or seven o’clock, till
noon. During the latter part of the afternoon he
answered calls in various parts of the city. By these
calls he came into the homes of the people and became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
better acquainted with them than he could have
done under ordinary circumstances. He gives what
he calls a fair specimen of the missionary physician’s
life in Siam when his hands are full:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“When I awaked in the morning found two sets of
servants waiting for me—one from Prince Chao Fah
Noi, who had sent his boat for me to go up to his palace
just as soon as I could finish my breakfast; another from
Chao Arim, the King’s brother, wishing me to come over
and see some one in his palace very sick. My first duty
of course was to attend to little George, whom I found
still living, though much the same. This occupied the
time before breakfast. After a hasty meal, stepped into
the sampan sent for me (the servants still waiting to
take me across the river to Chao Arim’s)—having dismissed
the Prince’s servants with a note requesting to be
excused. On the other shore entered gates of the city
wall.... While I was waiting for the Prince to be
notified of my arrival, servants gathered around; examined
my clothing, one wished me to take off my hat to
see if my head was shaved, another admired my watch—the
ticking pleased the children mightily. Some strong
ammonia I had pleased them very much. A young man
with a flaming long jacket of red silk (no shirt or vest
above his waist cloth) came out; all servants squatted
on the ground. This young Prince conducted me up a
rude ladder to the bamboo dwelling of the sick man.</p>

<p>“Returning, invited to see the great man himself. The
audience halls of these great men are after all rather
well-adapted to the climate; immense rooms, lofty ceilings,
furniture of matting, etc. Returning to my place,
found a boatman from the Moorish Madras merchant’s
awaiting me. Accompanied the Hindoo, who had been
sent for me, in his open boat with umbrella over my
head; the sun, however, very hot, though this is our cold
season. Some distance down the river landed at the
Nackodah’s commercial establishment, and found myself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
in the midst of quite a number of intelligent looking and
polite Mahommedan Hindoo merchants and clerks, with
their picturesque costume; the turban of twisted shawl
and robes of thin white muslin, and sandals. Was received
very courteously, conducted to a bamboo house
nearby. The patient, a fine looking man, swarthy, with
aquiline nose and mustache, lay on a mat bed behind a
screen.... And now the voice of Dit, a servant of
Chao Fah Noi, was heard; he had followed on after me,
not finding me at home—the Prince being very desirous
of seeing me. So I stepped into the handsome boat he
had sent, and was soon at the palace. Here received
with a smile of welcome.... Wished me to shew him
how to make chlorine gas. Succeeded well. Gave him
a piece of fluorspar and directions for etching glass.
Left several jars of chlorine. His boat in readiness to
take me back.... In the evening a call from Prince
Ammaruk, in his priestly yellow robes, several priests
with him.”</p>
</div>

<p>All these interesting scenes and varieties of experience,
however, did not lighten the burden of the heart.
When a patient suffered pain and inflammation after
an operation, he cries out:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“How can I go forward in a profession where I may
inflict suffering. If it was only injury to property and
not to life and health and senses! Alas, how hard a
destiny, how could I choose this profession!”</p>
</div>

<p>On a Saturday night he sighs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“And so ends another week during which mercies
have been ever changing, ever new. It has been a week
of labors for Christ ... and yet, though my poor head
is ready to ache with the task of deciding, judging, prescribing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
I find a sweet kind of weariness that comes
from serving Jesus Christ.”</p>
</div>

<p>Such a tender heart and sympathetic nature suffered
most where it could help the least. The obstetrical
customs of the country in particular caused the
doctor both distress and irritation on account of the
lamentable ignorance displayed and of the needless
sufferings caused.</p>


<h3>CHEER FROM GRATEFUL PATIENTS</h3>

<p>The experiences of his professional practise were
not all depressing. Operations were successful in
spite of his fears, and when least expected. Most
cheering was the gratitude of the patients, many of
whom acknowledged their lives reclaimed from death
by his hands. The marks of appreciation on the part
of some of these were most touching.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Have been permitted by a gracious providence this
week to have the happiness of saving the life of a
fellow-creature, which the venom of a poisonous snake
was appearing fast to be destroying. Poor fellow, he
was thankful enough. The first symptom of returning
consciousness before he regained his lost power of
speech was his attempt to put his feeble hands together
and raise them to his forehead in token of his gratitude
to his doctor. When three days after, sound in health
and limb, he came to see me. ‘Doctor, you are very,
very good,’ was his very emphatic expression of what
filled his heart. And then he grasped my hand—a liberty
men of his condition in life seldom take—in both his and
repeated, ‘You are very, very good.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. House had adopted the policy of gratuitous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
service. His motive was to exemplify the Christian
spirit by rendering these inestimable benefits without
charge. Perhaps at the time he did not know the
philosophy of the Siamese in the matter of good
deeds.</p>

<p>The theory of the Buddhist religion is that a good
deed gains merit for the doer. As a sequence, to be
the recipient of a favour is to assist the other person
to earn merit; and since the merit is ample reward for
the good deed it is not necessary to make any personal
return for the favour received. When Dr.
House later came to understand this philosophy he
perceived why it was that “of ten healed only one
returned to give thanks.” Yet there were not a few
whose natural sense of gladness was not wholly suppressed
by their religious theories. One day, three or
four years after he had been in Siam, he went out
along one of the canals into the country to a limekiln
to get some lime for the new house under construction
at the mission. An old woman came out to wait
upon him, and to his surprise she refused to take pay;
and explained that some time previously the doctor
had healed her little girl.</p>

<p>The set policy not to accept fees was not so easily
understood by the Chinese to whom he ministered.
Frequently, to avoid offense, the Doctor found it
necessary to compromise by accepting gifts in lieu of
money; and then he would be the recipient of generous
presents of fruit, quantities of rice, numerous
cakes of sugar and small chests of fine tea—gifts in
such abundance that he had to share them with his
friends to dispose of all.</p>

<p>But not least of the rewards for professional service<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
did he esteem the acquaintance and friendships among
the patients. These people came from many parts of
the country and there were numerous representatives
from other countries. Sailors from European ports
sought him out for medical treatment, Chinese tradesmen
and junk captains, Malays, Burmese, Peguans,
Cambodians, Lao, and the foreign merchants from
India. Then, too, Bangkok the capital of Siam was
visited periodically by officials from the distant
provinces, many of whom came for professional advice
to the foreign physician. The contact established
with these various peoples, and especially with the
provincial governors, served to excellent advantage in
after years when the doctor made tours into the far
regions. In particular, the under-Governor of Petchaburi
who came for professional advice, invited the
doctor to visit his provincial capital, and in later years
when he had been promoted in office and rank in
Bangkok he remained the steadfast friend of Doctor
House.</p>


<h3>WITH THE PATIENTS</h3>

<p>There were bits of humour now and then amidst
the procession of human tragedies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“While feeling the pulse of the patient and holding
my watch to count its beat, another man sitting by
begged me to feel his, and after I had counted it he
gravely asked me ‘in just how many years after this he
would die.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Some of the humour was grim humour indeed; for
one day he was hastily summoned only to find that
the supposed patient was a corpse. Humourous from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
one point of view but quite perturbing for a physician
was the innocent disregard for the directions left with
medicines; indeed the doctor could never tell whether
the failure of a prescription was due to the ineffectiveness
of the drugs or to the failure of the patient to
take the medicine as prescribed, for he found that the
patient was liable to take the whole potion at once or
just as liable to have another member of the family
take the remedy vicariously.</p>

<p>Quite frequently, when the callers from a distance
came to see him, they made the parting request for
medicine to take home with them, and thought it
altogether needless for the doctor to know what disease
they expected to use it for. Pathetic was the
case of the cholera patient consumed with fever who
begged the doctor to give “medicine to cure the desire
for drinking water.” Even more simple-minded was
the old man who came to inquire if he could be healed
if he “wyed” to Jesus,—that is to make the reverential
bow of worship customarily accorded to the
image of Buddha. Then there was the deaf man who
came back to report that he had read “the Christian
book of magic” and that it had failed to cure him.</p>

<p>Not the least perplexing of these absurd situations
was the difficulty of securing necessary permission to
administer the medicines even after the doctor had
been especially summoned:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The poor woman who lay on a mattress bolstered up
was in great distress evidently—and I soon found that
no time was to be lost. I shall never forget how piteously
she turned her anxious eyes towards me as she
faintly said, ‘Can you heal me?’ I recommend certain
treatment. Nothing could be done, however, till the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
matter had been submitted to the Praklang. So a messenger
was despatched, <ins class="corr" id="tn-22" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: His Excellancy again">His Excellency again</ins> aroused
from his nap;—and what a message brought back: The
application of hot cloths would be permitted, but the
more effective treatment proposed was something new—he
did not know—he could not consent to it. Thinking
then of another mode of treating the case and not
dreaming but that this I might venture to give—but no;
this prescription must be reported to headquarters before
it could be administered. Again a messenger was despatched.
The answer came back: we must wait to see
what a hot fomentation would do; if this did any good
then the prescription might be tried.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II<br />
“THE MAN WITH THE GENTLE HEART”</h2>

<p class="drop-capy">“This day thirteen years ago, while a just-arrived
student at Dartmouth College, it
pleased my sovereign Maker to manifest His
everlasting love to me by inclining my heart to choose
Him as my portion, and His service as my reward.”</p>

<p>Such is his salutatory in the service of God, as recorded
by Samuel R. House, in his journal under date
of Feb. 22, 1848. He had been in Siam less than a
year; long enough however for the novelty of his
situation to abate a little so that he had time to reflect.
Reflecting, he sees how that youthful dedication was—so
far as he was consciously concerned—the beginning
of the lines of life that led him to Siam.</p>

<p>Four years later, on the anniversary of his arrival
in Siam, contemplating the fruitlessness of those years
and ready to incriminate himself for “a culpable
ignorance of the language,” he again writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“How different doubtless am I regarded at home by
over-esteeming friends. How false a biography would
that be, some of them would write.... Let no one
eulogise such a character, such a worthless, unworthy
life as mine. If a Christian hope be the joy of my life,
by the grace of God I am what I am; but my waywardness,
my inefficiency is all my own.”</p>
</div>

<p>The cause of this despondency was not within himself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
It was the miasma arising from the spiritual
decay around him. But as none liveth unto himself,
so none dieth to himself. The example of such persistent
faith belongs to the church; and it has too
great a value for the living to allow the judgment of
a passing despondency to prevail.</p>

<p>At length comes the valedictory. On the occasion
of the fiftieth anniversary of the beginning of permanent
work in Siam by the Presbyterian Church (U.
S. A.) in 1897, Dr. House wrote to a friend:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“And now in my eightieth year, sole survivor of that
little band, I feel it a privilege indeed to look back and
see what God hath wrought since that day of small
beginnings. Verily the little one has become a thousand—yes
thousands. I am sure you, my friend, will congratulate
me on being yet alive this blessed day of an
abundant ingathering from that long barren mission
field. How the loved ones that have entered into rest
would rejoice if they could see how their patience of
hope and labour and love have not been in vain in the
Lord. There are many in heaven to raise the song of
jubilee with them, even there.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">From that early dedication of self to God while in
college, through the years “cast down but not destroyed,”
to the golden jubilee—what a strain of
human effort, what a magnificent persistence of faith,
what a glory of hope realized!</p>


<h3>HIS CHARACTER</h3>

<p>The man who had this notable experience would
not have been singled out, even by those who knew
him intimately in early manhood, as the one most
likely to achieve the results which we are to review.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
The qualities casually observed by acquaintances were
in his case those which men do not ordinarily associate
with success. A study of his private journal and
letters manifests traits which are corroborated by
many who knew him personally. He was a man of
deep piety. He was scrupulous regarding the outward
appearance of religion, yet more so concerning
his inner life. He was verily a man of God. His
mental nature had a strong inclination to introspection,
which led to self-depreciation and self-distrust.
He recoiled from a new venture until he became convinced
that it was the will of God; then, though still
distrusting his own ability, he laid hold of the task
with a simplicity of faith and a devotion to duty
which made him invincible. It is an example of
how the Holy Spirit, when fully occupying a man’s
heart, enlarges and fortifies his native capacity
until the one who is small in his own esteem becomes
a giant.</p>

<p>That habit of introspection may have been due in
part to the austere idea of religion which prevailed at
the time; at any rate it gave him a somber demeanor.
The solemn side of life seems mostly before him,
although his associates found a playfulness and jocularity
about him that offset his soberness. Only
thirty years of age when he left home, yet from the
first his letters to his father read more like the letters
of a father to a son. But deeper and stronger than
either of these traits was his tender sympathy. It was
more than a sympathy of sentiment; it was a sympathy
that caused him to share the sufferings of
others. Concerning his medical work he said: “When
I cannot relieve, I suffer.” This eagerness to relieve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
pain led him to a forgetfulness of his own interests
which his physique marvellously endured.</p>

<p>Then, too, he had a timidity which at times
amounted to phobism and made it difficult for him to
reach a decision and even caused him to appear fickle
in purpose. But fortunately, along with that weakness
he had a courage which nerved him to face any
hostility or danger with a daring which compelled
opposition to give way; and by that quality he carried
through many a venture which for a time seemed
doomed to failure. Humble to a point of self-abnegation,
at times he was as lordly as a monarch in
the exercise of the prerogatives of the liberty of the
gospel; and beyond a doubt it was his refusal to imitate
oriental truculence before provincial officials
which inspired that class with respect for the rights
of the foreigner. Among the Siamese who still remember
him, he is spoken of as “<em>the man with the
gentle heart</em>.”</p>


<h3>HIS PARENTAGE</h3>

<p>Samuel Reynolds House was born in Waterford,
New York, Oct. 16, 1817, being the second child of
John and Abby Platt House. His parents both united
with the Presbyterian Church of that village upon
profession of faith, in 1810. At that time the Waterford
congregation was in collegiate relation with the
congregation of Lansingburgh, located eastward
across the Hudson River, under the pastorate of Rev.
Samuel Blatchford, D.D. In the next year John
House was elected an elder in the collegiate church;
and when the Waterford congregation became a separate
organisation, in 1820, Mr. and Mrs. House became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
charter members of the new organisation, and
Mr. House was continued as an elder—an office which
he held till his death, April 27, 1862.</p>

<p>The active interest of Mr. House in the spiritual
work of the church is indicated by the fact that he
conducted a Sunday school for coloured children in a
room in a carpenter shop, and when the young church
erected a house of worship, in 1826, this Sunday
school was transferred to the gallery of the church.
He is also recorded as having been the superintendent
of the regular Sunday school of the church after it
was established. His interest in the church continued
active up to the close of his life. In his later years,
when the congregation was considering the construction
of a new “session house” for the use of the
Sunday school and prayer meeting, John House
sought the privilege of erecting the building at his
own expense; and that fine building, erected in 1859,
remains today as a memorial to his love and zeal for
the church.</p>

<p>Abby House was one of the original members of
the “Female Cent Society” of the Waterford church,
organised in 1817. The object of this society was to
“afford assistance to poor and pious young men pursuing
their studies in the theological seminary at
Princeton.” The quaint name of this society was
double with meaning. Each member was pledged to
contribute one cent a week to the fund, which was
then placed in the hands of the moderator of Presbytery
to dispense. Later the society co-operated with
the American Education Society until the General
Assembly forbade that organisation to operate within
the denomination in competition with the new Board<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
of Ministerial Education. The word “female” suggests
that the sex was about that period emerging
into the self-consciousness of a separate work for
religion and was not content to keep its labours hidden
behind the mask of the male portion of the families.</p>

<p>If we were to seek for the motives that led young
Samuel to dedicate himself to foreign missions we
would not be surprised to find that the mother had
some of the credit. He says that he was prompted to
become a missionary because his mother dedicated
him to God for foreign missions from his infancy.
Out of that maternal inspiration came also the prayer
of his youth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Make me a good boy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a blessing to my parents</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a blessing to all the world.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The ambition thus early implanted was nurtured during
the boyhood years by stories of missions. When
in later years he visited the Hawaiian Islands on his
way to Siam he recalls those stories:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“How little did I dream I was ever to see them, when
that dear mother of mine used to tell me such interesting
stories about the missionaries there and show me, out of
her treasures kept in that always-locked drawer of her
bureau, the precious bit she had of native cloth made of
the bark of a tree. And when she took me to the
‘Monthly Concert,’ as she always did, how much I used
to be interested in news from those far away isles.”</p>
</div>


<h3>RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS</h3>

<p>Closely associated with the motives to enter the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
mission field are a man’s religious convictions. Those
earlier missionaries were conspicuous for their lively
sense of peril for impenitent souls. Dr. House had a
spiritual sensitiveness which shared this feeling to the
full. Frequent lamentation is to be found in his
journal for the certain perdition of ones with whom
he had been acquainted, and who died without an evidence
of accepting the Christian faith. This was not
merely a professional attitude towards the heathen.
Upon news of the death of an old school mate he
exclaims:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Oh, did he die safely! What would I not give to be
assured he did. But oh, I tremble. Procrastination thou
art the thief of time, the murderer of souls. And conscience
reproaches me with having too long postponed
the sending to him that letter on the subject of the
claims of personal religion, a draught of which has for
years been lying in my portfolio. It might, under the
blessing of the Holy One, have done him good—at any
rate it was my duty, my privilege to invite him, to urge
him to walk with me towards heaven. I have sinned.
I have been unfaithful.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">When a Siamese lad who had been connected with the
mission for a few months was suddenly carried off by
the cholera, the anguish of the doctor brought him to
tears of self-reproach, not because his skill had failed
but because he had not been more insistent in urging
the gospel upon the boy.</p>

<p>At this distance of time one can see that the failure
of some of the Siamese to be persuaded was due to a
want of concatenation in the heathen mind between
the physical facts already familiar to them but not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
comprehended, and the spiritual truths of this new
religion. Behind the sublime faith of the missionary
there was a rigidity of logic which failed to take these
mental difficulties into account; as for instance when
a young priest proposed this dilemma: “Who was the
mother of Jesus? Mary. Who made Mary? God.
Was Jesus Christ God? Yes. But if Jesus Christ
was God, how could He make Mary his mother before
He Himself was born?” Turning from the disputant,
the doctor declined to discuss the problem
because he thought the man was caviling.</p>

<p>At one period the doctor entertained a vivid expectation
of the culmination of the Christian dispensation
at an early date. He had enough of the
mystical in his religious nature to look for signs.
Thus he writes in view of the conditions of Europe
in 1848:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“All Europe, every kingdom has felt the shock of the
political earthquake in France. Kingdoms, principalities
and powers tremble. These are signs that herald the
near approach of the Coming One. The day of the
world’s redemption surely draweth nigh.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And again two years later he writes to Dr. D. B.
McCartee at Ningpo:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Surely the world must needs wait for but few of the
signs, that are to herald His coming, to be fulfilled.
‘Wars and rumors of wars,’ earthquake and pestilence
and famine, the ‘running to and fro,’ the gospel preached
for a witness in every nation—what signs of the ‘ends
drawing nigh’ is left unfulfilled in our day—unless it be
that a few countries (central Africa, New Guinea, etc.)
remain still unevangelised. The last of God’s elect, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
may be born—nay, the messenger who is to call
him, in Providence may have started on his errand; and
who knows but that privilege is for you or me.”</p>
</div>

<p>But that type of speculation has its own antidote,
viz., time. As his years drew out their number, the
visions of youth gave way to the dreams of old men;
and in reviewing what had been achieved and what
remained to be accomplished the doctor displaced
these speculations with the simple faith that the Lord
would come again in His own time, but at a time unrevealed
to men. It needs to be remembered that Dr.
House had been trained in medicine, not in theology.
Whatever may have been illogical in his tenets, there
was in his heart the profound conviction not only that
Jesus Christ was the only Saviour of the world, but
that the Siamese would accept the Christian religion,
if only they could be induced to examine fairly
its claims.</p>


<h3>EDUCATION</h3>

<p>Samuel received a careful and thorough education.
After elementary work in the private academy of
Waterford, at the early age of twelve he spent a year
or more in the “Washington Academy” of Cambridge,
New York, then under the principalship of
Rev. Nathaniel Scudder Prime. In later years he recalled
with pleasure some of his classmates: “We
read Cæsar together; John K. Meyers, David Bullions
(Latin grammarian), E. D. G. Prime (editor of the
<cite>New York Observer</cite>), and I recited to Samuel
Irenæus.” In 1833 he entered the Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute at Troy, five miles from home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>In the winter term 1835 he entered Dartmouth
College at Hanover, New Hampshire, but remained
only till the close of that academic year. It was here
that occurred the deeper spiritual experience which he
recalls in the words that open this chapter; a conscious
conversion during a revival which swept
through the college that winter. It was following this
experience that in the same year he united with the
Waterford church upon profession of faith. Why he
did not continue at Dartmouth does not appear; probably
the difficulty of access would have been a chief
factor. However, in the fall of that year he entered
Union College, at Schenectady, a few miles from his
home. His work at Rensselaer and Dartmouth qualified
him to enter the junior class, so that he graduated
in the year 1837. He received the degree A.B. in
course and the honour of <ins class="corr" id="tn-32" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: Φ B.K.">Φ.Β.Κ.</ins>; and following three
years of post-graduate work in teaching, he received
the degree M.A. from his alma mater. The three
years immediately following graduation from Union
were spent in teaching; one year in Virginia, a year as
principal of Weston (Conn.) Academy and a year as
principal of the private school “Erasmus Hall,” in
Brooklyn. He now entered upon his medical course,
spending the year 1841-2 in the University of Pennsylvania,
and the next year in the Albany Medical
College. With the lapse of a year not accounted for
in the record,—probably teaching in Virginia, to
which he refers in telling of some chemical experiments—he
graduated from the College of Physicians
and Surgeons of New York with the degree
M.D. in 1845.</p>

<p>Upon completion of his medical course he offered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
himself to the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions
(Old School), and was commissioned in 1846.
He was assigned to Siam together with his college-mate,
Rev. Stephen Mattoon, of Sandy Hill, New
York, (now Hudson Falls). Placing himself under
the care of the Presbytery of Troy he was licensed
to preach.</p>

THE LITTLE CHISEL ATTACKS THE BIG
MOUNTAIN</h2>

<p class="drop-capy">Siam was the first nation of the Far East to
make a treaty voluntarily with Europe. Siam
was the first Asiatic power with which the
United States entered into diplomatic relations. Siam
was the first Oriental people to adopt Western customs,
upon accession of King Chulalongkorn, in 1868.
Siam was the first non-Christian land to grant religious
liberty to its subjects in relation to Christian
missions, in 1870.</p>

<p>Siam was the first field entered by the Presbyterian
Board of Foreign Missions after its organisation.
In Siam was organised the first Protestant
church of Chinese Christians. In Siam the first
zenana mission work was undertaken. Siam is the
last independent state in which Buddhism is the
established religion.</p>

<p class="pbot15">Yet Siam is little known to Western people. She is
neither belligerent nor turbulent, therefore offers no
military spectacle. She has no foreign ambitions,
therefore arouses no diplomatic concern. Her trade
is largely with China, therefore she makes no impress
upon the commercial mind of the west. She lies off
the beaten path of world traffic, therefore tourists
seldom visit the land.</p>

<p class="center p1 pbot15">SKETCH MAP OF SIAM</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Siam lies in what was formerly known as “Farther<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
India.” Shaped somewhat like a long mutton-chop,
the northern portion is an irregular-oval, approximately
six hundred by five hundred miles in reach,
from which a long narrow leg extends some five hundred
miles southward down the Malay peninsula.
Within the fold of these two portions lies the Gulf of
Siam. The main portion of the land lies between 12°
and 20° 40′ north, and is confined on the east by
French possessions and on the west by British
Burmah.</p>

<p>Northern Siam occupies almost the entire drainage
system of the Menam River, and a part of the western
watershed of the Mekong River. The central part
abounds with swamps, jungles and briny wastes, intersected
by many branch streams and canals. The
bulk of the population live along these watercourses.
Bangkok is the largest city, and is both the commercial
and political capital. Chiengmai is the principal
city of the northern province, which was formerly
known as Laos but is now a political part of the
kingdom.</p>

<p>The relations of Siam with the nations of the west
date back to the days of the Portuguese adventurers
in the early part of the sixteenth century; relations
which were not diplomatic but purely commercial.
About the middle of the seventeenth century the king
of Siam entered into relations with the English,
French and Dutch, but only to the extent of an exchange
of royal courtesies, which after a time became
quiescent. Intercourse with the west was renewed by
Siam when, upon her solicitation, a treaty was made
with Great Britain in 1826. Doubtless fear was the
motive which prompted King Phra Chao Pravat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
Thong, who reigned from 1824 to 1851, to propose
this treaty, for England had just compelled the neighbouring
state of Burmah to open her doors to trade
as the result of war.</p>

<p>The volitional act of the Siamese monarch was apparently
a shrewd stroke of diplomacy, for having
granted the right of trade admission and inland travel,
the king adopted a policy of ignoring the few foreigners
within his domains and thereby discouraging
his people from having intercourse with them. At the
same time he held a monopoly of Siamese shipping
and levied heavy impost and expost so that what trade
there was served to enrich his private treasury. In
1833, Honourable Edmund Roberts, who had been
sent by President Andrew Jackson to explore the possibilities
of trade with the native states of Farther
India and Cochin China, succeeded in effecting a
treaty only with Siam. The privileges granted under
this treaty were not exercised to any great extent and
were almost allowed to lapse because no consular
representative was appointed. The early American
missionaries relied chiefly upon the privileges kept
alive by the “factories,” as the foreign trading establishments
in Bangkok were called.</p>


<h3>EARLY MISSIONS</h3>

<p>When one of the early missionaries explained to a
nobleman that their purpose in coming to Siam was to
supplant the native religion by Christianity, the nobleman
replied: “Do you then with your little chisel
expect to remove this big mountain?”—referring to
Buddhism. How this mountain began to crumble
during Dr. House’s twenty-nine years of service will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
be best understood by giving a sketch of the work
previous to his arrival.</p>

<p>The early treaty with Great Britain gave first entrance
for Protestant missions. In 1828 Karl Gutzlaff,
M.D., of the Netherlands Missionary Society,
and Rev. Jacob Tomlin, of the London Missionary
Society, went up to Bangkok to spy out the land.
Before that date the Siamese had been the distant
object of interest on the part of Ann Judson, of Burmah,
who, as early as 1819, having met some Siamese
at Rangoon, became interested enough to prepare in
their language a catechism and the Gospel of
Matthew—the first Christian books in the Siamese
language. While Gutzlaff and Tomlin found the
doors of Siam open and discovered that there was a
considerable Chinese population there, they were not
encouraged by their supporters to effect a permanent
occupation. For this reason they issued an appeal to
the American Church then newly awakened to missionary
zeal, sending one copy of the appeal to the
American Baptist mission in Burmah and another to
the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign
Missions in the United States. This message was
taken to America in 1829 by Capt. Coffin, of the
American trading vessel which at the same time
brought the famous Siamese Twins.</p>

<p>The A. B. C. F. M. was the first to respond. In
1831 they directed one of their men located at a
Chinese treaty port, Rev. David Abeel, M.D., to proceed
to Siam and make a survey. At Singapore he
was joined by Mr. Tomlin, who had returned thither
for recuperation, and the two reached Bangkok just a
few days after Dr. Gutzlaff, disheartened by the death<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
of his young wife, had sailed away to China. Mr.
Tomlin this time remained only some six months, but
Dr. Abeel continued until November, 1832, when he
was forced to leave on account of health. His survey
of the field resulted in a report to the A. B. C. F. M.
which induced them to attempt a permanent work. In
the meantime, in 1833, the Baptist mission in Burmah
responded to the appeal by sending two of their number,
Rev. J. T. Jones and wife, to establish a mission.
Two years later Rev. Wm. Dean was sent out from
America by the Baptists as a co-labourer of Mr. Jones
but to devote himself particularly to the Chinese.</p>

<p>In pursuance of Dr. Abeel’s report the A. B. C. F.
M. sent out two men, Rev. Stephen Johnson and Rev.
Charles Robinson, who reached Bangkok July, 1834,
and these were joined the next year by David Bradley,
M.D., and wife. Both the Baptists and the A. B.
C. F. M. at this time regarded their work in Siam
largely as a point of vantage for China proper on
account of the large number of Chinese here accessible.
The work among the Chinese was so fruitful
that in two years’ time Mr. Dean was able to organise
a church among them, the first church of Protestant
Chinese Christians ever gathered in the Far East.</p>

<p>Siam was the first field to be taken up as a new
enterprise by the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions
after its establishment by the General Assembly.
Until 1831 the Presbyterians in America had functioned
chiefly through the A. B. C. F. M. in their
foreign work. In that year a few presbyteries west
of the Alleghanies organised the Western Foreign
Missionary Society, to conduct their own foreign
work. Beginning with missions to the Indians (then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
regarded as “foreign”) they established work in
India and Africa in 1833. The direction of its own
foreign work by the church was one of the points involved
in the division of the Presbyterian Church into
the New School and the Old School in 1838. The Old
School took over the Western Foreign Mission Society
in that year as a nucleus for a new Board of
Foreign Missions which their General Assembly established;
and that Board has been in continuous
operation ever since. In its first year the new Board
directed Rev. R. W. Orr to proceed to Bangkok and
report on the eligibility of Siam as a field for operation.
Mr. Orr reported, recommending not only work
among the Chinese but also advocating work for the
natives. Accordingly the Presbyterian Board sent out
Rev. Wm. Buell and wife, who reached Bangkok in
August, 1840, the first missionaries to be sent out by
the new organisation. These two remained for some
three years, when on account of ill health of Mrs.
Buell they were obliged to withdraw; and thereupon
the mission was suspended for a time.</p>

<p>When, as a result of the opium war, the doors of
China were opened, in 1846, both the A. B. C. F. M.
and the Baptist society transferred their Chinese
workers from Siam to China. The difficulty of getting
response from the Siamese had caused their
workers to devote their energies largely to the Chinese;
and now when this Chinese work was terminated
their missions in Siam were greatly weakened
both in numbers and in effectiveness. The A. B. C.
F. M. retained its Siamese workers until 1849, when
it transferred its enterprise to the American Missionary
Association, an organisation distinctly of the Congregational<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Church; but this Association abandoned
the field in 1874. In 1868 the Baptist Society gave
up all except its work for the Chinese in Bangkok,
leaving the Siamese wholly to the Presbyterian Mission.
Thus Siam was freed from sectarian rivalry
long before modern “comity” was brought into
practise.</p>

<p>It was at the juncture of withdrawing the major
portion of the force to China and leaving the Siamese
missions undermanned that the Presbyterian Church
undertook to establish anew its mission in Siam, having
the native population as the primary objective.
To that end it sent out Dr. House and Mr. Mattoon
who, together with Mrs. Mattoon, may rightly be
regarded as the founders of the permanent work of
the Presbyterian Church in Siam.</p>


<h3>THE VOYAGE</h3>

<p>In those days of foreign travel it was necessary to
await a vessel that might by chance be sailing in the
direction of the desired destination. Fortunately the
ship <i>Grafton</i>, Captain Abbott, was found to be loading
for a direct voyage to China, and passage was
obtained for a party of missionaries en route for the
Orient, including the trio for Siam. On July 27,
1846, the <i>Grafton</i> sailed from New York.</p>

<p>A journey to the Far East then was a matter of
time and tedious delays, as well as of adventure.
The course of the <i>Grafton</i> lay southward through
the Atlantic, now near the coast of Africa, now near
the coast of South America, with glimpses of Liberia
and of Brazil; around the Cape of Good Hope and
across the Indian Ocean, among the East Indies and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
thence northward to China. The indirectness of the
voyage by which Dr. House reached Siam is shown
by this fact: one hundred days after leaving New
York, the <i>Grafton</i> put in for water at Ampanan on
the island of Lombok, one of the smaller of the East
India chain. This port was within four weeks’ direct
sail of the Siamese capital; whereas the <i>Grafton</i> was
headed for the port of Canton, to reach which required
fifty days more; thence by another vessel it
was necessary to retrace the course to Singapore and
transfer for Bangkok.</p>

<p>Could the missionary have taken passage direct
from Ampanan to Bangkok he would have reached
his destination in about two-thirds the actual time
consumed. But even the most direct course to China
could not then be taken because the season had arrived
for the northeast monsoons on the China Sea,
which are a peril to sailors. The <i>Grafton</i> was compelled
to pass to the eastward among the Isles of
Spice, past Pelew Island, out into the Pacific, east of
the Philippines, within sight of Formosa and thence
westward to Canton. The doctor writes home to the
children of the Sunday school that “It was a dream
of childhood come true to sail among these fabulous
islands.” On the 28th day of December, one hundred
and sixty days from New York, the <i>Grafton</i> arrived
at Macao, the Portuguese port for Canton, which
during the stormy days of early foreign relations
with China was a place of safe entry, transfer and
retreat for merchants and missionaries alike.</p>

<p>No vessel was to be found bound towards Siam, so
the missionaries had to wait. The American merchants
Olyphant &amp; Co., of Canton, with hospitality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
“as generous as it was elegant,” took the doctor into
their home for the sojourn during the delay. Dr.
House visited the mission school of Dr. Happer,
located at the port, and also went up to Canton to
visit the hospital conducted by Dr. Parker, who had
been a lecturer in the University of Pennsylvania
when he was a student there. On Feb. 7, the party
for Siam took passage on the <i>John Bagshaw</i>, Captain
Dare. After a call at Hong Kong they had a quiet
passage southward through the China Sea, and on the
23rd reached Singapore, the maritime capital of the
South China Sea.</p>

<p>Here they were fortunate in finding in the harbour
the native-built trading vessel <i>Lion</i>, Captain Dupont,
owned by the King of Siam. Although the ship was
modeled after western vessels, it was of the rudest
native workmanship, without conveniences for occidental
travellers; and even the orientals who took
passage had only deck space allotted to them. For
these three Westerners one small cabin was made
available and had to serve them day and night for the
twenty-four day voyage, a sail cloth being suspended
in the middle as a concession to foreign ideas of
privacy. Provisions had to be secured at Singapore
and the Chinese cook of the vessel paid to prepare
them.</p>

<p>The passage from the South China Sea into the
Gulf of Siam proved to be the climax of the whole
trip. A violent and prolonged storm was encountered
which not only added greatly to the misery of the
ship’s company but imperiled their lives:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“For nearly three days,” writes Dr. House, “we have
not had one cheering glimpse of the sun. Squall after
squall of rain has burst in its fury upon us; indeed it
has been almost one incessant rain, and the wind all
the time from the most unfavourable quarter has at last
increased to a gale, driving the ship from her course
towards we know not what islands and rocks.... The
waves are rolling wildly, scowling rain clouds begird the
horizon and shut out the sky above us and the view
before us. It is now three days since the captain has
been able to get an observation, and the dead reckoning
is in these seas little to be depended upon, owing to the
strong currents. Our situation is no more safe than it is
agreeable.... Every wave rolls us also to and fro, so
that if one sits or stands he is obliged to be continually
bracing himself, now this way, now that, to keep the
center of gravity; and every now and then is pitched by
some sudden lurch against the nearest object so that
sides and arms and elbows fairly ache with the bruises....
And all this time there is in your ears the creaking
of the rudder chains and the dismal splashing of the
great waves as they surge up under the stern windows.
But a greater annoyance yet remains to be spoken of.
The deck over us (the roof of our cabin) leaks in a
hundred different places upon us, not in drops but in
streams. In my compartment there is but one dry
place, and that is the mattress; and even that is not
wholly dry, for now and then it drops down upon the
pillow. The floor is as wet as if being mopped; wet
trunks, wet books, wet baskets lie around. The chairs
are too wet to sit upon, and so the bed is the only place
for rest.”</p>
</div>


<h3>WELCOMED BY OTHER MISSIONARIES</h3>

<p>Fortunately the voyage of twenty-four days was
not all like this, and after the storm had abated there
was much to make the days interesting. At length
came the first sight of Siam:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Friday, March 19. The first sight of Siam. Thy
people, O Siam, shall be my people; <em>but</em> my God shall be
their God. Here would I die and here would I be buried....
Henceforth I would live for Thee, my God.
Thou art a kind Master; and oh, Thou hast bought me,
every power and faculty; Thou hast bought me by Thy
precious blood. Let me henceforth shrink from nothing—but
sin and remissness in Thy blessed service. With
the beginning of my missionary life I give myself anew,
tremblingly but trustingly to do Thy will O God, my
Creator, Guide and Redeemer.”</p>
</div>

<p>The following day, Saturday, March 20, 1847, Dr.
House landed in Bangkok. The arrival of the new
missionary party met with a most cordial welcome by
the small group of fellow Americans already engaged
in the work. At that time Siam was occupied by two
American missions, besides French Catholic missions.
The American Board was then represented by Rev.
Jesse Caswell and Rev. Asa Hemmenway with their
wives; while the Baptist Board was represented by
the following men and their wives: Revs. J. T. Jones,
Josiah Goddard, and E. N. Jenks, and Mr. J. H.
Chandler, a lay missionary.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Early on the morning of the 20th of March, just
eight months to a day from the time of our leaving New
York, we found ourselves at the bar which obstructs the
entrance of the great river of Siam.... I was despatched
with the captain in a swift, but alas open, boat
that I might, if the ship was unable to get over the bar,
make arrangements with friends to send down for Mr.
and Mrs. Mattoon. After a rather broiling row of some
twenty miles along a river far more beautiful than I had
been led to suppose, arrived at the outskirts of this truly
great city about sundown. We had still some three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
miles or more before we reached the residence of the
missionaries of the A. B. C. F. M., and it was then dark.
Was most kindly welcomed by Mr. Caswell <ins class="corr" id="tn-45" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: and Mr. Hemmingway"> and Mr.
Hemmenway</ins>, the only missionaries of that Board now
left; and glad indeed they appeared to see me.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">On Monday the ship came up to the city and by that
time plans had been made to house the newly arrived
missionaries in two of the vacant houses in the mission
compound where they had been welcomed.</p>

<p>The relations between the three sets of missionaries
were most cordial. So far as economy of effort made
it wise they co-operated in their undertakings. It was
the dispensary of the A. B. C. F. M. that Dr. House
re-opened. The tracts used by the three missions
were printed by the press of the Baptist mission.
Members of each of the missions took turns at the
tract house maintained in the bazaar. Although the
Presbyterians had previously been engaged in work
in Bangkok they held no property there; and for the
present it was neither advisable nor possible for the
newcomers to obtain a location for themselves. It
was arranged that they should live in the A. B. C. F.
M. compound until there was time to obtain a desirable
site.</p>

<p>The compound contained several houses built after
the native style; set high upon posts, with an open
space beneath, a verandah on all sides, no windows
but openings for air. In one of these houses Dr.
House lived for the first two years, having a servant
to take care of the house but taking his meals with
the Mattoon family. This arrangement entered upon
temporarily continued by force of circumstances for
three years until the return of Rev. D. B. Bradley,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
M.D., with another physician, when a readjustment
of housing was necessary. Thereupon Dr. House
moved to one of the “floating houses” moored in
front of the compound, and this continued to be his
abode for more than a year until a permanent site was
secured for the mission.</p>

<p>The members of the three missions held a common
service of worship each Sunday morning and afternoon.
At the morning service the sermon was in
Chinese or Siamese, while the afternoon service was
wholly in English. It is interesting to learn that an
“original” sermon was unusual, the preacher of the
day commonly reading a published sermon of some
well-known divine. On Wednesdays there was an
informal conference for all workers and servants.
On Saturday evenings there was a prayer meeting for
the missionaries only. Later a “monthly concert of
prayer for missions” was established. When the
number of Chinese increased a separate service was
held for them, and likewise a Sunday school for the
Siamese pupils of the day school.</p>

<p>Occasionally there would be in attendance on worship
some officers from any English vessel in port
and then in turn one of the missionaries would visit
the vessel and conduct a preaching service for the
crew. After the treaty of Great Britain, in 1855, the
number of English families increased very rapidly,
and while at first many of these attended the services
at the mission, their number soon warranted the
erection of a chapel for their own use.</p>

RELATIONS WITH ROYALTY AND
OFFICIALS</h2>

<p class="drop-capy">Soon after their arrival Dr. House and Mr.
Mattoon were taken by their fellow missionaries
to call upon two princes who had manifested
a friendly interest in the westerners. The
acquaintance thus formed proved to be of large influence
both to the mission and to the Siamese nation.
One of these princes was entitled Chao Fah Yai,
which signifies “The older brother of the king,” while
his brother was entitled Chao Fah Noi, meaning “The
younger brother of the king.” As Chao Fah Yai
later became King of Siam and his brother the Vice-King
at the same time and as this new king played a
momentous part in the opening of Siam to intercourse
with the western nations as well as showed much
favour to the mission work, it is essential to give a
sketch of that important personage.</p>

<p>When, in 1824, the throne was made vacant by the
death of the royal father of these two men, the older
son had expected to succeed to the throne. Apparently
this had been the father’s intention, for he had
given this son the name “Mongkut,” meaning
“crown prince.” Through intrigue, however, the
crown went to a half-brother who, under the title
Phra Chao Pravat Thong, was the reigning king
when Dr. House reached Siam. Chao Fah Yai, having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
been thwarted in his aspirations towards the
throne, entered the priesthood and retired to a watt,
doubtless as the safest way to avoid the royal displeasure
towards a rival,—a course which the custom
of the country made possible for him.</p>

<p>The princely rank of this priest made him the
leader of the Buddhist religion in Siam; and his great
wealth enabled him to make his watt one of the most
notable and influential in the country. He was a man
of enlightened mind beyond his generation. In
marked contrast to the king, he was interested in foreign
affairs and amicably disposed towards the few
foreigners living in Bangkok, especially towards the
missionaries, because of their education and culture.</p>

<p>Having already learned Latin from the French
priests, in 1845 (then about forty years of age), he
invited Rev. Jesse Caswell, a missionary of the
American Board, to become his tutor in English. To
secure the services of Mr. Caswell he offered in return
a reward which he perceived would be more prized
than any fee of gold he could propose. He offered
Mr. Caswell the privilege of using a room in one of
the buildings connected with the watt for preaching
the Christian religion and distributing tracts, and
granted permission to the priests of the watt to attend
if they wished. Mr. Caswell accepted the invitation
and continued for three years, until his death, to teach
English to the chief Priest of Buddhism in his own
temple, and to preach Christianity to all who cared to
listen. The esteem of the Prince for his tutor is evidenced
by the fact that in 1855, when Dr. House was
returning to America on furlough, he made the doctor
the bearer of a gift of one thousand dollars to Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
Caswell’s widow in token of appreciation of her husband’s
services, and again in 1866, by the same agent,
he sent a gift of five hundred dollars. He also caused
a monument to be erected, in memory of his tutor, at
the grave of Mr. Caswell.</p>

<p>The more one contemplates the terms made by
Chao Fah Yai with Mr. Caswell the more astonishing
it appears. Here is the most influential priest in all
Siam, the recognised head of the Buddhistic cult in
Indo-China, inviting into his watt an uncompromising
teacher of the Christian religion notwithstanding the
known antipathy of the king to the westerners and
their religion, and in return for instruction in the
English language he grants him freedom to teach the
moral and religious doctrines of Christianity within
the precincts of consecrated ground and permits
novitiates and priests under his authority to listen to
that doctrine.</p>

<p>This broadmindedness of Chao Fah Yai is further
shown by an incident which he related to one of the
Protestant missionaries. Sometime previous to the
engagement of Mr. Caswell a young priest of the watt
became a Roman Catholic. The prince was urged to
flog the young man for abandoning the religion of his
country. To this suggestion the prince said he replied:
“The individual has committed no crime; it is
proper for every one to be left at liberty to choose his
own religion.” On a later occasion the Governor of
Petchaburi, having forbidden the distribution of books
by the Roman Catholic priests in his province because
he said they sought to shield their converts from the
authorities when accused of crime, conferred with
Chao Fah Yai as to whether he should place the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
ban on the books of the Protestants; but the Priest-Prince
was able to explain to him the difference of
policy between the Roman Catholics and the Protestants
and to dissuade him from forbidding the distribution
of Protestant literature.</p>

<p>From his intercourse with Mr. Caswell, Chao Fah
Yai was quickened with an interest in Western learning,
especially the sciences. By his association with
these missionaries and the discussion of the evidences
of Christianity he came to recognise that his own religion
had accumulated a mass of unauthenticated
teachings, the accretion of centuries of priestly fancy;
and he perceived that this accretion must be sloughed
off if his religion was to meet the pressure of foreign
civilisation, which he foresaw could not be forever
excluded. Accordingly he became the leader of a new
party in Buddhism which rejected the uncanonical
writings which had accrued to the extent of some
eighty-four thousand volumes and held only to the
authentic teachings of Buddha. As the leader of this
new sect the Prince-Priest was doubtless responsible
for the reinvigoration of the religion of Siam, enabling
it better to meet the contest of time.</p>

<p>The interest of Chao Fah Yai in the American missionaries
was more on account of their intellectual
culture than on account of their religion. On one
occasion in conversation with Dr. House he frankly
said that while he did not believe in Christianity he
thought much of Western science, especially astronomy,
geography and mathematics. His interest in
these subjects was very keen and practical. From the
study of navigation he was led into the subject of
astronomy, and took interest in the calculation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
time, and was especially proud that his own calculation
of an eclipse of the moon was almost identical
with the Western almanac. His conversation showed
considerable intelligence of the late developments in
science. He was also a student of languages, and had
a knowledge of several languages of eastern India,
such as Singhalese and Peguan; he was familiar with
Sanscrit, which had been a contributor to the Siamese
language, and had studied Latin because he said he
had been told that it was like the Sanscrit; besides
these he was an expert student of the Pali, the sacred
writing of Buddhism. The prince was also the first
native prince of Farther India to procure a printing
press, which he obtained from London, with fonts of
English and Siamese type, and an alphabet of Pali of
his own devising.</p>

<p>Apparently Chao Fah Yai approached the subject
of Christianity as a vigourous mind approaches any
ponderous subject that presents itself; he considered
it philosophically. Every religion studied philosophically
presents insuperable difficulties; a religion may
be rightly judged only by its practical adaptation to
life and its effects on the human heart. Had he attempted
to study Christianity in a practical manner as
he did the science of the West his conclusions would
doubtless have been different. One evening the prince
called at the home of Mr. Caswell just as the weekly
prayer meeting was assembling and, upon invitation,
remained to the meeting. His questions afterwards
showed that he had given attention, for he inquired
the meaning of such words as “redemption” and
“Providence,” which he had heard used.</p>

<p>While it is a fact that on several occasions the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
prince emphatically disclaimed belief in the Christian
doctrines, nevertheless the arguments of the missionaries
were not without effect upon his mind, for he
felt himself called upon to do an entirely new thing—to
publish an apologetic for Buddhism in the points
where the Christian arguments were most aggressive.
In another manner also he gave evidence that the
Christian arguments were pressing upon his conscience.
The Baptist mission for some years had
printed an annual almanac filled with Christian truth
and containing, besides other items of civil information,
a list of officials of the government and of the
watts. In 1848, for the first time, Chao Fah Yai took
exception to the religious character of the almanac in
which his name appeared as head priest of his watt.
He wrote to the editor of the almanac, expressing a
“wish to have added to the description of myself in
the English almanac ‘and hates the Bible most of
all’; we will not embrace Christianity, because we
think it a foolish religion. Though you should baptise
all in Siam I will never be baptised.... You
think that we are near the Christian religion; you will
find my disciples will abuse your God and Jesus.”</p>

<p>Concerning his attitude to Christianity a comment
from Mrs. Leonowens’ book, <cite>An English Governess
at the Siamese Court</cite>, casts a little light:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“He had been a familiar visitor at the houses of
American missionaries, two of whom Dr. House and Mr.
Mattoon, were throughout his reign and life gratefully
revered by him for that pleasant and profitable conversation
which helped to unlock for him the secrets of
European vigor and advancement, and to make straight
and easy the paths of knowledge he had started upon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Not even his Siamese nature could prevent him from
accepting cordially the happy influence these good and
true men inspired. And doubtless he would have gone
more than half way to meet them, but for the dazzle of
the throne in the distance which arrested him midway
between Christianity and Buddhism.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was the Priest-Prince upon whom the newcomers
made their first call of respect. The acquaintance
formed at this time ripened into a friendship
that continued warm and true to the end. Dr. House,
in his journal, carefully records the details of the call:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“His Royal Highness was somewhat unwell, but he
would come down. A servant was sent to ask if we
would not take some refreshments. Soon a plate of
stone-fruit was presented, resembling in flavour our
peach; also a plate of Chinese cakes, white and thin,
with a bowl of dark Chinese jelly and sugar. Knife,
three-pronged fork and teaspoon were brought and we
made an excellent tiffin.</p>

<p>“I looked around the room; Bible from A. B. Society,
and Webster dictionary stood side by side on a shelf of
his secretary, also a Nautical Tables and Navigation.
On the table a diagram of the forthcoming eclipse in
pencil with calculations, and a copy of the printed chart
of Mr. Chandler....</p>

<p>“This man, if his life is spared, is destined to exert an
all-powerful influence upon the destinies of this people.
He must possess a vigour of mind and much energy of
purpose thus to commence the study of a new language
at the age of forty. Indeed he seems Cato-like in other
things....</p>

<p>“Soon the Prince-Priest appeared with two or three
following, dressed in yellow silk robes worn as a Roman
toga. His manners were rather awkward at introduction,
and his appearance not prepossessing at first,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
though we became more interested in him as we saw
him more. He seated himself on a chair by the center
table, and asked our names and ages and whether married.
Wished to know if I could cure sick as Dr. Bradley
did. Whether I could cure the dropsy, for there was
a case in the watt. He understands English when he
reads it, but cannot speak it well yet.</p>

<p>“We asked to see his printing room; several young
priests and servants on bamboo settees folding books.
One composing type, one correcting proof. They gave
us a copy of a book published in the Prince’s new Pali
alphabet—it was the Buddhist ten commandments and
comments on them. Mr. Caswell had previously told him
of the present of a keg of printing ink we had for him
from our friend G. W. Eddy, of Waterford. He asked
who it was from, and if ‘they had heard of him in
America’; and was evidently well pleased to find that he
was known. Upon taking leave, he promised to call in
return upon his guests in a few days.”</p>
</div>

<p>This call of the new missionaries was returned by
the priest, and on several occasions afterwards he
visited the Doctor in his house. Occasionally he
would send notes by his servants requesting various
favours, medical attendance upon inmates of the watt,
loan of books. On a second visit, when Dr. House
went to engage the services of a young priest as instructor
in Siamese, the prince proposed that the
Doctor should come over to the watt and make use of
the room which Mr. Caswell occupied for his class in
English, and “there distribute medicines and teach
the young men of the watt how to be doctors.”
Among the papers of Dr. House was found an autograph
letter in English written by Chao Fah Yai about
this time inviting him and the other missionaries to
attend a cremation ceremony at watt Thong Bangkoknoi;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
and offering him the privilege of distributing
religious books among the head priests assembled
there from several watts and to preach to them on the
new religion. On other visits he inquired about
the new instrument that “would send intelligence
quickly” (the telegraph), asked why American vessels
so seldom came to Bangkok, and discussed the
difference between the Latin and English Bibles.</p>

<p>In proper sequence of courtesy the new missionaries
were taken to call upon the other prince, Chao
Fah Noi. For some reason this prince had withdrawn
from his former intercourse with foreigners, but he
very courteously received the callers and was manifestly
pleased with the attention. He, too, was interested
in Western learning and especially inclined
towards the physical sciences. On the palace grounds
he had several shops, one for a forge, one for iron
lathes, one for wood-working. Power for all this
machinery was developed by slave-muscle. In one
room was a working model of a steam engine, two
and a half feet long, made entirely by the prince’s
own hands. Being somewhat unwell he consulted Dr.
House, but explained that he was under the King’s
physician and to refuse to take his medicine would be
an act of disrespect to His Majesty, and for that
reason would not ask Dr. House to prescribe for him.</p>

<p>The acquaintance thus formed was used, at first, by
the prince more as a means of securing personal instruction
on physical sciences. Frequently servants
were sent to Dr. House to borrow books or to ask for
advice on chemistry, electricity, photography, lithography
and kindred subjects; and on various occasions
the doctor was summoned to the prince’s palace only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
to find that his assistance or instruction was desired
in some experiment. In after years, however, when
Chao Fah Noi had become Vice-King upon the accession
of Mongkut, his intercourse with Dr. House
rested more upon the basis of friendship.</p>


<h3>SCIENCE AND RELIGION</h3>

<p>The acquaintance thus conventionally begun was
quickened in mutual interest in an unexpected manner.
When Dr. House reached Siam he found that
the Baptist Mission press had for some time been publishing
an annual almanac. He perceived that these
almanacs were not only accepted by the ordinary people
as they would accept Scripture tracts, but that
they were eagerly sought after by a small number of
nobles who were interested in Western science. These
men were surprised to find that the eclipse for 1847
was much more accurately forecasted in this almanac
than by their own astrologers, and they were eager to
discuss the subject of astronomy.</p>

<p>This observation together with his own interest in
science led him, in September of his first year, to institute
a series of lectures for the benefit of the servants
and employes of the mission compound “in
hopes of waking up their dormant minds and accustom
them to think, and so be a little benefitted by the
preaching on the Sabbaths; as well as to impart useful
information and to set before them the great proof of
the existence and wisdom of the Creator, a fundamental
truth all Buddhists deny.” The doctor was to
furnish the outlines and perform the experiments
while Mr. Caswell, experienced in the language, was
to do the talking. There was a fair equipment at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
hand: chemicals, a magnetic machine, a globe, a set of
physiological and hygienic charts and a skeleton.</p>

<p>The first lecture was on the digestion of food and
the effects of alcohol on the stomach. The audience
showed their attention and interest by responding with
questions. After the lectures on physiology came several
on astronomical topics such as the eclipse of the
moon, phases of the moon and relation to the tides;
then followed several on the gases. On the occasion
of the first lecture on the gases, it so happened that
Godata, a priest from Chao Fah Yai’s watt, happened
to call on Mr. Caswell and was invited to witness the
experiment. The demonstration opened a new world
for him. What he saw was too wonderful to keep to
himself; he spread abroad his report and the effect
was immediate.</p>

<p>The first to respond was Prince Ammaruk, the
favourite son of the king, who requested the privilege
of watching the doctor create the wonderful
“winds.” On the day appointed for the special experiment,
Chao Fah Yai sent a request for Dr. House
to accompany him that evening to call upon a brother
prince who was quite ill. In reply the doctor explained
his engagement for the evening, but offered to
make the call after the demonstration, and suggested
that the Priest-Prince might himself like to witness
the experiment. To the doctor’s surprise, the Priest-Prince
came early in the afternoon to take the doctor
to see the patient, so that they might have the whole
evening free for the experiments. At the palace,
Chao Fah Yai explained the evening’s entertainment
to the royal physician (a brother of the king) who
promptly invited himself. By arrangement with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
Prince Ammaruk several others were to come, so
that at the appointed time the small house was filled
with nobles and princes, and the verandah with
their servants. Fortunately the experiments went
off successfully; oxygen was generated and iron was
burned in the oxygen; hydrogen was generated
from water and exploded in combination with oxygen.
Chao Fah Yai was particularly enthusiastic,
and called in from the verandah some of his men to
see the wonders, and himself volunteered to explain
the facts to them.</p>

<p>The series of lectures awakened widespread interest
among the progressive nobles. Dr. House became a
notable in their esteem. Nearly all of the group who
were present on that evening were amateur scientists;
they had the air pump, the electric machine and other
physical apparatus, but of chemistry they had no idea.
Shortly after this Chao Fah Noi, who had been keeping
aloof from foreigners, sent a request for Dr.
House to spend the evening at his palace and instruct
him in the making of gases. How long the series of
lectures continued is not apparent; the journal continues
reference to them while they are novel, but they
apparently continued throughout that winter. Other
subjects named were “The Weight of the Atmosphere,”
“The Barometer,” “Heat,” “The Oxyhydrogen
Blow Pipe,” “Carbon and Carbonic Gas,”
“Electro-magnetic Telegraph,” and “Electricity.”
The original purpose of instruction for the servants
was outgrown, and week after week one or more of
the nobles who were dabbling in science were present
with their ubiquitous train of servants. From this
time on the journal indicates that the doctor’s instruction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
in the Bible classes took the form of “Evidences
of Natural and Revealed Religion.”</p>

<p>The popular interest, however, was directed towards
a particular subject, the skeleton. Very quickly
news of this strange possession spread abroad, and
every few days in season and out of season visitors
would call and, scarcely able to restrain their inquisitiveness
during the preliminary courtesies, hasten to
request a sight of the skeleton. Even some of the
ladies became interested in this curiosity; and one day
a woman of rank, with half a dozen attendants and a
train of servants, came with a request to see the skeleton.
Long after local curiosity had subsided, chance
callers from distant provinces would come to see this
object of nation wide gossip.</p>

<p>Very remarkable, the skeleton itself did not seem to
make so profound an impression upon these minds as
the “argument from design” which their instructor
deduced from the human anatomy to prove the existence
of a Creator. Female curiosity also called for
demonstrations with the electrical machine. During
the reign of the old king some of the ladies of the
palace had a prince arrange for Dr. House to bring to
the prince’s palace the machine which could make
“<ins class="corr" id="tn-59" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: fi fi">fi fah</ins>” (fire from the sky), that they might see the
marvel. The doctor, of course, was not permitted to
enter the presence of the king’s women, so he had to
instruct the prince in the method of operation.</p>


<h3>BOND OF INTEREST</h3>

<p>An unexpected result of these lectures was that a
bond of mutual interest was established between Dr.
House and this group of progressive nobles, the very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
party which in a few years dominated the new government
of Siam. It would be interesting for one
who knew the official entourage of King Mongkut to
note how many of his supporters were included in this
number who made Dr. House their friend because of
his interest in science. Since Siamese noblemen were
known by titles rather than by family names and since
these titles change through elevation to higher rank
only one acquainted with a person at a particular rank
could identify these men with accuracy.</p>

<p>However the following are frequently mentioned in
Dr. House’s journal as showing a friendly attitude to
him, and most of them interested in Western science.
In the régime which began in 1851 his friends were:
the king, the vice-king, the prime minister, the
commander-in-chief, the minister of foreign affairs,
the minister of home affairs, the treasurer of the kingdom.
In the régime of Chulalongkorn, which began
1868, his special friends were: The second king, the
regent, the minister of foreign affairs, the master of
the mint, the commander-in-chief, and the court chaplain.
Besides these were several princes and nobles
who did not occupy particular offices. Several of
these men had primitive laboratories or workshops for
experiments.</p>

<p>The series of lectures started such a revival of interest
in scientific matters among them that Dr. House
soon found himself the frequent host of several
princes and nobles, seeking instruction in all sorts of
subjects; and he was on various occasions invited to
their shops to inspect their work or elucidate some
obscure difficulty, as though he were a peripatetic professor.
He was even seriously troubled by the borrowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
of books and instruments which they were not
all punctilious to return. Moreover, he found himself
an agent of some of these men, ordering machinery
and supplies and tools from America for their use.</p>

<p>Chao Fah Noi said to him confidentially that any
one who wanted to do something new in those days
must do it in secret, for if the king learned of their
activities he would call upon them to work for him so
as to keep them from pursuing investigations. This
prince, however, was not altogether secret in his experiments,
for under date of July 4, 1848, Dr. House
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“This a. m., we saw something new on the river—a
little model steamboat, not twenty feet long, with
smoke-pipe, paddle wheel, all complete, steaming bravely
against the tide, with H. R. H. Chao Fah Noi sitting at
the helm. It was the first native steamer on the Meinam,
entirely his own construction.”</p>
</div>

<p>But not for one moment did Dr. House lose sight
of his prime objective. The favour of princes was no
reward in itself; he was always concerned for the influence
he might exercise through his contact with
men of power:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“How taken with the new science is the Prince (Chao
Fah Noi). Oh, that acquaintance and opportunity given
me with him may be improved to win and turn him from
his trust in false gods and rites! He has a good mind.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Not a lecture, scarcely a conversation, on science but
Dr. House sought to point out the unanswerable argument
from “design in nature” as a proof of a Creator
and of the truth of Christianity. To some, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
revelations of nature through science became also the
revelations of a Divinity.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Brother Chandler spoke of a person (Godata) who
after attending the chemical lectures last year, seeing evidence
of wisdom and goodness in the composition of air
and water, said ‘There must be a God—there must be.’”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This same Godata it was who became chaplain to the
army under King Chulalongkorn.</p>

<p>A study of Dr. House’s journal seems to justify the
assertion that his most far-reaching influence upon
the mission work was through his relations with these
progressive members of the nobility. It is even within
a margin of safety to affirm that his influence was not
exceeded by that of any other man up to the time of
his retirement. This opinion does not underestimate
such men as Rev. Jesse Caswell, Rev. Daniel B. Bradley,
M.D., and Rev. Stephen Mattoon, whose labours
also were pivotal in the development of missions in
Siam. It only so happened that the association of Dr.
House with the officials of the new government was
more continuous in its bearing upon the work. Having
gained their sympathy through his practise of
medicine, and enlarged their interest through his
knowledge of science, he won their complete confidence
by his sterling character. When later these
men, having obtained chief power in the government,
turned to him for counsel in international affairs or
when he went to them in behalf of the mission they
knew that his judgment was fair and free from ulterior
motive. During nearly the entire period of his
service he was a valuable friend of the Siamese government
and a wise advocate of the mission at court.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="V">V<br />
LENGTHENING CORDS AND STRENGTHENING
STAKES</h2>

<p class="drop-capy">A direct effect of this growing interest in
science was to show the value of Western
education in such a way as to create a demand
for the educational work of the mission. Not
satisfied with their own enlightenment several of these
progressive nobles requested Dr. House to tutor their
sons in English with a view to instruction in science.
As early as 1847, before the doctor himself could
devote time to such work, Mrs. Mattoon had undertaken
to tutor Kuhn Gnu, the son of the Praklang.</p>

<p>While at the tract house one day the doctor caught a
glimpse of the desire and capacity of the common people
for learning. A boy applied for a book. Knowing
that the lad had received one the previous day, the
doctor began to catechise him on that volume before
giving him another. He was surprised to find that in
a day’s time the boy had mastered the details of the
story of Elijah. Upon this the doctor observes:
“Now this is in effect, as far as it goes, a school and
a Christian school, where more knowledge is imparted
perhaps than would be in a regular school.”</p>

<p>Under the régime of the old king no regular school
was possible, not only because the monarch was antipathetic
to western ideas but because the Siamese
had no common desire for education.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“It is next to impossible to interest the native Siamese
in education, because it is the custom for all boys to
enter a watt as novitiates for the priesthood, and as
such are taught to read; but to read is the limit of their
ambition.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The quickening of an interest in science among the
upper classes proved to be the awakening of some of
the younger generation to the desirableness of a
broader education than the priests ever thought of
giving.</p>

<p>The first mention of a school as a proposed department
of the mission occurs as an entry in the journal
on the first anniversary of the arrival in Siam, when
the doctor records briefly: “Plans for interesting and
instructing the young Siamese were discussed.”</p>

<p>Looking back over the course of affairs it is apparent
that the embryo of the mission school was the
receiving of some children into the homes of the missionaries
to be taught, while assisting in house work.
As early as 1848 Mrs. Mattoon, with an eagerness to
do something to elevate the condition of child-life,
succeeded in obtaining two girls for this purpose, one
of whom she named Nancy, after her own mother,
and one Abby, after the mother of Dr. House. Later
another was added, whom she named Esther.</p>

<p>In the next year Dr. House had apprenticed to him
a Chinese lad of thirteen named Ati, the nephew of
his Hainanese laundryman. The boy was bound for
a period of three years, during which he was to act as
a house servant in return for instruction in English.
As a matter of fact this boy remained in connection
with the mission for a much longer period. The part
played by these children was not simply a demonstration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
of their capacity for a Western education but,
even more importantly, they formed a nucleus around
which to organise a formal school later. Until time
was ripe for such an undertaking the missionaries
could only try in the most experimental way to develop
interest in education among the common people
with whom they came into more intimate contact.</p>

<p>Although Dr. House fitted himself for the medical
profession, he found that by taste and aptitude he was
essentially a teacher. His fixed purpose was to impart
to the Siamese the Christian truth about God and
about salvation, confident that this truth would
awaken the sleeping conscience. His discontent with
his profession was to a large extent because it hindered
him from the more direct propagation of the
Gospel. Observation early disclosed to him, what
other educators had discerned elsewhere, that the
chief obstacle to the consideration of the spiritual
message of Christianity was the false cosmogony as
held by the people.</p>

<p>Their idea of the universe was based upon a total
ignorance of many common facts of nature, an ignorance
which completely excluded from their minds the
idea of a spiritual God. They were so obsessed with
fallacies about natural phenomena that there was but
small common basis of physical knowledge upon
which the missionaries could build an argument to
dispose of these grotesque ideas. For instance, the
popular explanation of a lunar eclipse was that a great
dragon was trying to swallow the moon. When an
eclipse occurred, the people would set up a din of
kettles and drums to scare away the dragon. Since
the moon always escaped, the people were the more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
confirmed in their belief. Then there was the old
notion of the earth being flat. In the midst of the
earth was a great central mountain, whence Buddha
had come, surrounded by a vast plain; and inasmuch
as Siam occupied the middle of this plain, obviously
there could be no other greater country. Before truth
could penetrate such an armour of ignorance, it was
necessary that nature be stripped of these false ascriptions
in order that there might be a common ground
upon which to consider the arguments for the Christian
faith.</p>

<p>In the presentation of Dr. House’s message there
can be traced an orderly philosophy which reflects this
situation. First he sought to remove some of these
false ideas by pointing out common facts of nature
which the natives had never observed. Next he
sought to explain the conception of God as Creator.
From this he led on to the love and mercy of God as
revealed by Jesus. As a practical sequence he aimed
to give an elementary education to the few who would
receive it so as to demonstrate the Christian way of
life. This meant in the course of time the development
of a system of education.</p>


<h3>SCIENTIFIC INTERESTS</h3>

<p>Dr. House was peculiarly fitted for this work, for
he had been providentially prepared to draw upon a
wide range of scientific instruction. His years at
Rensselaer Institute had developed his taste for natural
philosophy and had given him a lifelong interest
in the progress of science. His study of medicine had
qualified him in practical chemistry, while his few
years of teaching gave him needed experience in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
laboratory demonstrations. While trying some experiments
with gas in Siam he recalls “occasions of
the same kind at Rensselaer school and in the Virginia
school.” Busy as he was, he managed to keep abreast
of scientific progress through the journals of science,
and was forward to adopt new ideas as he found
them. In March, 1847, he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“In evening read account of inhaling ether as a means
of enabling one to perform surgical operations without
pain to the patient. A wonderful discovery truly—inestimable
in its benefit to the suffering of our race—and
the author of it was an American.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">At the first opportunity he applied the new idea to a
patient in surgery:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Old woman of eighty-four; piece of bamboo eight
inches had entered her flesh, remaining still unextracted.
O, how I wished I had an apparatus for inhaling ether—I
prepared an extempore one.”</p>
</div>

<p>In 1851 he reads of “a new way devised in Paris
by suspending a pendulum from high dome to trace
and render visible the motion of the earth on its
axis”; and after a private experiment, straightway he
makes the demonstration for his science-loving Siamese
friends.</p>

<p>Like many missionaries, Dr. House was a student
of nature, contributing to other scholars his observations.
He was a member of the “American Oriental
Society.” He was a correspondent of the naturalist,
Mr. John C. Bowring, at Hong Kong, son of the diplomat,
for whom he undertook to collect and forward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
specimens of Siamese insects and shells; and in this
pursuit he became the discoverer of two varieties of
shells previously unknown to naturalists, to which his
name has been given, “Cyclostoria Housei” and
“Spiraculum Housei.” In his volume on Siam, Mr.
George B. Bacon, speaking of the flora and fauna of
Siam, remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The work of scientific observation and classification
has been, as yet, only imperfectly accomplished. Much
has been done by the missionaries, especially by Dr.
House, of the American Presbyterian Mission, who is a
competent scientific observer.”</p>
</div>

<p>In his modesty he was surprised to find that his
activities in this line were known in Europe. Dining
at the Prussian Embassy at Bangkok, in 1862, he was
introduced to the son of Chevalier Bunsen, who remarked
that “he had heard of Dr. House in Europe;
he has given his name to a new species of shell; he
was the first to make Siamese shells known to the
world.” When Dr. Lane left Siam, in 1855, Dr.
House took over from him and continued the
meteorological observations because “it may be valuable
by-and-by for the Siamese.” On one occasion he
had a bit of amusing chagrin in trying to determine
the elevation of a mountain. He had constructed a
new thermometer for himself and proposed to estimate
the altitude by ascertaining the boiling point.
After carefully explaining the theory to his native
companions, placing the kettle on the fire, he eagerly
watched for the first sign of boiling. To his astonishment
the thermometer indicated that the chosen position,
instead of being several hundred feet above the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
sea, must be many feet down below the earth’s surface—and
then he discovered that there was a fault
in his thermometer.</p>


<h3>EARLY TOURS</h3>

<p>For his eagerness to lengthen the reach of his arm
and to extend the range of his voice, Dr. House found
some satisfaction in occasional tours into the surrounding
country. These were at once a relief from
the exacting daily routine of the dispensary, a physical
recreation, and an exploration of the regions
seldom visited by Europeans. The first trip of any
distance was made in company with Rev. Jesse Caswell
during February, 1848, when the two took a
ten day trip through the canals eastward to Petrui
on the Bang Pakong River. In the next November,
with Rev. Asa Hemmenway, he toured for a
week to the west up the Meklong, with Rapri as the
turning point.</p>

<p>These early journeys were veritable explorations.
The boatmen seldom knew the country more than two
days’ distance from the capital. The doctor, in real
explorer fashion, picked up in advance what little information
he could, sketched rude maps and then on
the journey directed or verified the course of the boat
with a pocket compass. His technical knowledge
served to great advantage. For future use, he records
the directions by compass reading, the rate of speed
and the distances as shown by the log, and notes
natural objects which serve as landmarks. His skill
at map making having been disclosed, some of the
state officials requested him to draw, for their use,
maps of the regions explored; and in discussing these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
with them he found that the officials were almost
totally ignorant of the topography of the king’s domain
away from the main water courses.</p>

<p>As these tours were all conducted on the same general
plan, the description of one will suffice for all. A
native long-boat was used, having a low cylindrical
canopy of matting at the center to afford some protection
from the sun. A crew of six or eight men
would man the oars, or push with poles in shallow
canals or in the rapids. The travelling ordinarily
would begin before daybreak; during the heat of the
day the party would stop for meals and for rest; then
late in the afternoon the voyage would be resumed,
continuing till dark. If out over Sunday the travellers
were scrupulous to observe the day; seeking, if possible,
a desirable location for the day of rest, but
sometimes tying up in disagreeable places rather than
push on in the early hours of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>The watts, or temple grounds, ubiquitous in the
country, serve as caravansaries for travellers; their
roofs and trees offering free shelter for wayfarers.
As these watts were also the seats of learning, the
missionaries always found an opportunity to present
their printed page and to engage in conversation on
religion. Books were offered to all met with along
the way; to the fishermen seeking their game in the
early morning hours, to the women working in the rice
fields, to the labourers at the sugar presses, to the
farmers in their garden patches, to the villagers in the
hamlets through which they so frequently passed, and
to the priests and novitiates at the watts. Some were
too busy to bother with the proffered gift; some would
accept with passive interest; some would accept with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
marked interest and open a fire of questions. Still
others, after discovering the nature of the gift received
by their friends would pursue the voyagers,
and swim out to the boat in eagerness for a book.
Time did not suffice to enter into conversation, for the
purpose was to scatter the seed as far as possible, so
the boat would keep under way while packages were
cast out on the land or into passing boats. At the
noon stop, if natives did not gather around as usual,
the doctor would start off to the nearest hamlet with
a bag of books, sheltering himself under a large umbrella.
Then would ensue the familiar yet ever different
conversation about the Gospel.</p>


<h3>TO PETCHABURI</h3>

<p>After he became familiar with the methods, the
doctor was ready to make long tours, once freed from
the restricting cares of the dispensary. The married
men did not find it convenient to leave their wives and
young children for a long period so that this work
was largely taken up by the doctor, who gained a
keen relish for it. In December, 1848, accompanied
by Mr. and Mrs. Mattoon, Dr. House set out with two
boats for Petchaburi, the capital of the province by
that name on the western peninsula. The trip had
several points of interest.</p>

<p>In the first place the Lieutenant-Governor of the
province had come to Dr. House for medical treatment
a few months after his arrival; and being
pleased with his treatment, invited the doctor to come
to Petchaburi. Upon his recommendation the Governor
of the province also, while in Bangkok, came to
the mission house, curious to see the skeleton which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the doctor had. The Governor manifested such an
interest and friendliness that Dr. House resolved to
visit the provincial capital and discover the possibilities
of mission work. Arriving at Petchaburi, they
called upon the two officials and offered to them gifts
of foreign articles. When they were about to leave
for home, the officials in return sent very generous
presents of fruit and sugar to their boats. In later
years the under-governor, having been promoted,
made earnest solicitation for the missionaries to teach
English in his capital, and as an inducement offered
freedom to teach religion.</p>

<p>Another item of interest was of a different sort.
Having learned that the original home of the Siamese
twins was in the village of Meklong, near the head of
the Gulf of Siam, the Americans sought out the family.
They found only one brother living there, and
learned that a sister was living in Bangkok, while the
mother had died a year previously. The brother expressed
a longing to see his brothers again or to hear
from them; and at the doctor’s own suggestion he
wrote a letter to the absent twins, dictated by the
brother. It told of the pious wish of the dying mother
for them “to do merit for her spirit.” Some years
later, when Rev. Daniel <ins class="corr" id="tn-72" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: McGilvray visited the">McGilvary visited the</ins> twins
in their home in South Carolina, they spoke of receiving
this letter.</p>


<h3>TO PRABAT</h3>

<p>In the winter of 1849 Dr. House and Mr. Hemmenway
made a trip to Prabat, about one hundred miles
to the northeast of the capital. This place is the site
of a watt erected over an imprint in the rock, reputed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
to have been made by the footstep of Buddha. At
that particular season of the year multitudes come
from all parts of the kingdom to do homage to this
“shadow” of Buddha. The doctor gives quite a detailed
description of his experiences:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“A rocky mount, covered with a pagoda, rose before
us to the height of three hundred to four hundred feet.
On a lower elevation in front of this peak is the famous
foot print; over which stands a very beautiful tho excessively
ornamented structure, with elegant pillars on
a side supporting a pagoda-like gilded roof, towering up
seven stories, gracefully diminishing till they terminated
in a handsome golden spire. On a rocky summit on the
left stood a small pagoda, and on the right a higher eminence
was crowned with a similar sightly structure. Before
it was a long flight of stone steps leading up to the
platform on which it stood. We ascended these steps,
crossed a little court, entered another a little higher—and
without ceremony entered the half-open door of the
sanctuary before we were forbidden. Had we delayed a
moment perhaps we should have lost the opportunity and
had the gates closed against us. But we were in and
made as good use of our eyes as we could during the
few moments we were allowed to continue. More than
one voice was raised in the silence that had prevailed
within, saying to us we must go out, go out, or else kneel
down and worship. One man with an air of authority
came up and took us by the shoulder, ordering us
roughly to take off our hats and shoes. So we went out.</p>

<p>“But we had seen the grave-like opening at the bottom
of which the sacred footstep is said to be, though
covered as it was with broad pieces of gold leaf and
cloth of gold, and women kneeling low before it in an
attitude of profound homage. The pavement of the
room is of solid silver, the square blocks smoothly polished
by the votaries as they pass in and out on knees.
The footstep is said to receive annually a great amount<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
of gold, while offerings of rings and other articles of
value are thrown into the opening not infrequently.”</p>
</div>

<p>Leaving the sanctuary the visitors climbed on up to
the top of the hill to survey the country. Returning,
Dr. House became separated from his companion;
and as he approached the scene of the fabled footprint,
he stopped to look at the elegant pagoda. Soon
a crowd gathered around him, and in answer to a
priest he explained why they had not worshiped
before the footprint. Some were wondering at his
garments; others were wondering at the unheard-of
boldness in resolutely keeping on a hat while on holy
ground. While he was talking, a rude push from
someone behind and then yells from a hundred throats
gave a threatening aspect to the situation. Fortunately,
at that critical moment, a Bangkok priest, an
old acquaintance, recognised him and was not afraid
to come to the rescue. He then withdrew in safety,
and finding Mr. Hemmenway, the two returned to
their elephants and took up the journey to the boats.
In the narrative of this trip Dr. House records having
come upon a boy of about fourteen years, born without
arms or legs, but perfect in other respects. The
arm-bone was projected about four inches, covered
with skin, calloused at the end from use. The boy
could not raise or feed himself, but could make slight
change of position by rotating alternately on each
thigh.</p>

<p>A number of tours were taken in the dry seasons of
’49 and ’50. One through inland waterways to the
Bang Pakong River and thence northward above
Nakonnayok, meeting many Lao people living on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
river-bottom farm lands. Another to a point some
two hundred miles up the Meinam, and a year later
yet another trip was made as far as Paknampo, some
three hundred miles up the same stream, and thence
two days’ journey up the right fork of the Meinam.</p>

CHOLERA COMES BUT THE DOCTOR
CARRIES ON</h2>

<p class="drop-capy">The first recruits for the Presbyterian work
came in 1849, when Rev. Stephen Bush and
his wife arrived. Mr. Bush had been a college
mate of Dr. House and Mr. Mattoon, and he
came from Sandy Hill (now Hudson Falls), N. Y.,
the home town of the Mattoons. This little company
of Christian men and women now decided to organise
a church as a bond of fellowship and for the orderly
administration of the sacraments. When it is considered
that they had not yet won a single convert
from either the natives or the Chinese, it is a remarkable
testimony to their faith that they should have
taken this step in anticipation of the future harvest.
Dr. House records this action in his journal under
date of Aug. 31, 1849:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“After tea we had a meeting of the members of the
mission, and with all due solemnity organised a Presbyterian
church in Bangkok, by the election of Rev.
Stephen Mattoon as our pastor, and S. R. H. [Doctor
House] as ruling elder. Brother Mattoon as senior
member of the mission presided, reading at the opening
of the meeting the first chapter of Revelation, that introduces
the address to the seven churches of Asia by their
Glorious Head.</p>

<p>“In the name of the Great Head of the Church we,
a little band of five, united together in a separate church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
organization, the beginning of great things we hope—the
germ of the tree that shall overshadow the land.
The lay members of this infant church were S. R.
House, Mrs. Stephen Mattoon, and Mrs. Stephen Bush.”
[Mr. Mattoon and Mr. Bush being clergymen were not
eligible to membership in a local church.]</p>
</div>

<p>At the first communion of the new church, held on
Sept. 30, a Chinese Christian was received:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“In the evening at a meeting of the Church Session
Quasien Kieng, the native member of the A. B. C. F. M.
mission church (received by Messrs. Johnson and Peet
on January 7, 1844) was received into our membership
on certificate of recommendation from the pastor, Rev.
A. Hemmenway. An interesting occasion to us. A
worthy brother, this Chinese disciple; may his wife and
many others come in with and through him.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This Chinese Christian, whose name is spelled variously
in the doctor’s journal and elsewhere, was
Kee-Eng Sinsay Quasien, who served as the first
Chinese teacher in the boys’ school and who became
the grandfather of Boon Itt, concerning whom more
notice will appear later. Up to this time, so far as
records show, there had been no genuine converts
from among the Siamese in any of the missions.
There had, however, been several from among the
Chinese. Indeed when the king was urged to take
action against the first missionaries he replied: “Let
them alone; no one will give heed to them except
the Chinese.” The first convert from among the
Chinese sojourners in Siam was Boon Tai, who
had come under the personal influence of Dr. Gutzlaff
previous to 1831. A few others were converted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
under the teaching of transient missionaries, and
then came Mr. Dean, who established the first church
of Chinese.</p>


<h3>THE CHOLERA EPIDEMIC OF 1849</h3>

<p>One day, in 1849, the startling news reached the
mission compound that cholera had appeared in
Bangkok. The plague spread very rapidly; almost
simultaneously it appeared everywhere in the city.
The very first notice of the presence of the pestilence
that came to the doctor was the news that the Siamese
printer connected with the Baptist mission had been
stricken without any premonitory symptoms and died
within a few hours.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“As may be imagined consternation seized upon all
classes. The native doctors fled from their patients.
Everywhere propitiatory offerings were made to the
spirits, the people generally believing the pestilence to
be caused by the invasion of an army of cruel malicious
demons who had come invisibly to seize mankind and
make them their slaves. And in accordance with this
theory the preventative most relied on was a strand of
cotton yarns, blessed by the Buddhist priests, which, tied
about the necks or wrists, it was thought the invisible
army could not pass. A cordon of such yarn hung looped
from battlement to battlement entirely around the royal
palace, a mile in circumference....</p>

<p>“Awakened at day break by a Chinaman in a floating
house across the river firing off crackers to propitiate
his god. Met a Chinaman well-dressed, carrying a
square frame on which little banners, red and white,
some rice and fruit, little new-made clay images of men
and animals, with little rags around them, red peppers,
betel leaf and nuts ready for chewing, the end of an old
torch—all laid down at a place where a dozen other such
offerings to the spirits were placed.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>With such preventives as the sole protection against
the cholera it is no wonder that the plague spread like
wildfire. It was no respecter of persons—a dowager
in the palace, a prince of Cambodia, a wealthy Hindu
merchant were victims like the most wretched natives.
The mortality was so inclusive that in many a house
there were more dead than living; and in some instances
the remnant of a family would abandon the
house with its horde of corpses. Many of the mission
servants and members of their families were attacked,
and some of these sent in great haste for Dr. House.
From early morning, all through the day, far into the
night he visited the sick.</p>

<p>Terrifying as the plague itself was, the fear of
death was almost eclipsed by the revolting disposal
of the dead:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“You know it is the Siamese custom to burn their
dead, but so fearfully did deaths multiply that a shorter
mode of disposal was resorted to, and multitudes of
corpses were thrown without ceremony, as you would
throw the carcass of a dog into the river. These dead
bodies could be seen any day floating back and forth
with the tide before our doors, in all stages of putrefaction—on
some of them crows perched, picking away at
their horrid feast.</p>

<p>“Go where you would through the streets, we would
meet men bearing away the dead, hastily tied up in a
coarse mat. The Siamese make loud lamentation at the
moment of the death of friends, and as one would pass
along it was no uncommon thing to hear the voice of
wailing from this house and that. Once on my way to
see a patient, the voice of one crying in great distress induced
me to enter the little bamboo dwelling, whence the
cry proceeded; and there on the mat-covered platform
of a gambler’s shop (for such it was) sat a middle-aged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
Chinaman with his head against the wall, sobbing at a
piteous rate. He took no notice of my entrance; but,
telling his only comrade that I was a doctor, I stepped up
to him to feel his pulse, but he was pulseless and his
limbs cold as stone—the hand of death was upon him.
And I went on my way leaving him all heedless of my
coming, crying bitterly as before.</p>

<p>“The most revolting spectacles were at the watts
where Siamese custom requires the dead to be brought
for burning or interment till burning is possible....
I have seen in one of these gehennas hundreds of loathsome
corpses in every stage of putrefaction lying around
unburied, unburned just where the hirelings that brought
them or their friends, too poor to pay the expense of
their burning, might throw them down—the hot sun and
the rain doing its work awfully.... My own eyes have
seen of such human carcasses, sixty thrown together in
one huge pile with sufficiency of wood and over thirty in
a smaller one near, all roasting, frying and burning to
ashes with a thick black smoke going up from the dreadful
pyre; with skull bones, legs half consumed, arms
stiff in death projecting on this side and that as the pile
settled down, till the men in charge with long poles
would thrust and twist them back into the blazing heap.
All day long, from an area of nearly an acre covered
with the ashes of other freshly burned victims of the
pestilence, would be continually going up the flames of
scores of individual funeral piles; and this not on the
grounds of one temple only, but from a dozen here and
there about the city. And then when evening came,
with the night air would be wafted to us such an unmistakable
odor of burning flesh and singeing hair and
bones.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the midst of his heroic labours, Dr. House awoke
one morning with what he felt to be the symptoms of
the cholera, and for a time he had dire thoughts of a
certain and speedy death; but instant resort to his effective<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
prescription and a quiet rest in bed for two
days averted the threatened disease. Then he
promptly resumed attendance upon patients. When
it is considered that his professional services were
sought in only a few instances, chiefly among the
friends of the mission servants, and that his own aggressive
zeal increased the number of patients treated
by him, the heroism of his conduct stands out in bold
relief. Even though there was no place of refuge for
the missionaries, had it been possible for them to flee,
yet their greatest security was to remain in such isolation
as possible within their premises. But Dr.
House’s eagerness to save the lives of men that they
might have a further chance to hear the Gospel impelled
him to risk his own life to minister to every
victim who would receive his services.</p>

<p>Concerning the prescription used during this epidemic,
Dr. House published a report of his experiments,
while in America in 1865, when there was
prospect of an outbreak of Asiatic cholera in the
United States. At first he began with the common
prescription of the medical books of that date; then
he turned to the use of calomel in very large doses,
with better results; later he says that he hit upon the
use of a mixture of spirits of camphor and water
taken every few minutes and found this to be a specific
for the disease, losing no patients under this
treatment provided the attack was taken in time.</p>

<p>In general, however, he was handicapped by two
difficulties. The disease made its attack so suddenly
and developed so rapidly that unless remedies were
applied at the earliest possible moment the end was
fatal; but to many of the cases to which he came, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
summons of the physician had been delayed until there
was no hope of saving life. The other difficulty was
equally fatal; utter heedlessness to the directions. No
amount of caution seemed sufficient to secure the imperative
attention to the prescription. One patient,
with a mild attack, he found to be dying when he
called later; and upon investigation found that she
had taken the medicine once when she should have
taken it twenty times, but in the meantime had resorted
to the powders of a native doctor. But in
spite of these obstacles, Dr. House reported that of
eight or ten really severe cases in the households of
the missionaries, none died, and that he had records
of seventy or more cures of persons elsewhere
dangerously attacked.</p>

<p>The mortality of this plague of ’49 was frightful.
During the climax of the epidemic deaths were occurring
at the rate of fifteen hundred a day in Bangkok.
The river was thick with floating bodies, and
vessels coming in reported that they had counted hundreds
of corpses floated by the tide seven days out to
sea. When the plague had at last abated the official
estimate of the number of deaths in Bangkok and
vicinity during the seven months was not fewer than
forty thousand.</p>


<h3>A CURIOUS MARK OF ROYAL GRATITUDE</h3>

<p>The episode of the plague had rather a curious conclusion.
When the pestilence had spent its force,
King Phra Chao Pravat Thong decided that he would
perform an “act of merit” in honour of Buddha for
the cessation of the epidemic. Since the religion of
Buddha requires great veneration for the life of animals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
one of the surest means to merit is to grant
freedom to animals that are in captivity. Accordingly
a levy was made upon every citizen to bring to the
palace ground a stated number of animals or birds
during a fixed period, and upon a given day these
were all to be liberated at the king’s command. To
the surprise of the foreigners residing in Bangkok,
they in common with the citizens received a demand
for a gift of pigs and fowls and ducks in varying
numbers and assortments.</p>

<p>The members of the Presbyterian Mission, assuming
that this liberating of the animals was a religious
rite, declined to make the requested present upon the
ground that they could not “consent in any way to
have anything to do with the system of idolatry in
the land”; but, to avoid the appearance of offense,
added that if the gift were a mere matter of custom,
they would offer the required present as a compliment
to the king. On the following day they received
word from the Pra Nai Wai, who had charge of the
levy, that the desired present had nothing to do with
the religion of the country but was merely intended as
a token of congratulation to the king on the occasion
of the abatement of the pestilence. In view of this
explanation, Dr. House and Mr. Mattoon reconsidered
their decision; and accordingly the required donation
was sent, accompanied by a letter of congratulation
with an expression of thanks to God and of a
Christian prayer for His Majesty’s welfare.</p>

<p>For three days the river was alive with craft bringing
the gifts to the landing at the king’s palace, where
the donor was credited. Then the gifts were taken to
the depot where the aggregation was being fed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
proper officers till the day of liberation arrived. It was
estimated that more than two hundred pails of rice
were necessary each day for feed. Then on the great
day a river procession took place, a gala affair such as
the Siamese frequently held on festal occasions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The river at one time this morning, as far as eye
could see around the bend and to the palace, had a procession
of boats with banners, white and red, with music
and beating of cymbals, with cages of all colours and
sizes and shapes—some one, two or four stories high,
some like beautiful pagodas, some shaped like vases;
some with flowers, some with banners representing by
picture the animals or birds contained in the cages.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">All proceeded to the river landing at the palace, where
the captives were set free. It was estimated officially
that nearly one hundred thousand fowls and ducks,
some five hundred pigs and numerous boat-loads of
live fish were included in the donations and were
set free.</p>

<p>The incident, however, did not end here. A like
request had gone to the French priests and the members
of their parishes. At first the Bishop gave permission
for the making of the present to the king;
but later when it was rumoured that the king would
liberate the captives to “gain merit,” the bishop not
only declined himself to make the gift but withdrew
his permission previously granted to his people. This
reversal caused great indignation among the officials
responsible for gathering the presents. After a conference
in which the bishop was informed, as the
other foreigners had been, that the gift was not regarded
as a participation in a religious rite but only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
as a customary token of congratulation, the bishop
returned to his original attitude, restored permission
to his people and offered a gift in his own behalf.</p>

<p>But thereupon a new turn in the affair developed;
the eight French priests conferred together and concluded
that the explanation was only a subterfuge, the
real object of the gift being an act of worship; and
they decided not to participate for themselves, notwithstanding
the bishop’s permission. This course
had the disadvantage of placing them in the position
of disrespect to the government, since their superior
had approved of the participation. Accordingly the
eight priests were admonished by the government that
if they refused to acquiesce in the royal request they
must leave the country. Remaining inexorable, the
order was given for their banishment, but the bishop
was permitted to remain because he had complied with
the request. This decree remained in force until revoked
by King Mongkut in 1851.</p>

<p>Some months later the foreign residents of Bangkok
were surprised to read in an English paper of
Singapore a statement that the deported priests, on
their passage through Singapore, had given;—a version
of the affair in which they appeared as heroes
who had chosen expulsion rather than participation in
pagan rites while the Protestant missionaries had purchased
exemption by acquiescence. Unfortunately
this interpretation of the incident to the glory of the
eight priests placed their own bishop in an unfavourable
light.</p>


<h3>ABANDONING THE MEDICAL PROFESSION</h3>

<p>The distress of mind which Dr. House felt so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
keenly over the perplexities of his profession, coupled
with eagerness for work that would give more direct
propagation of the Gospel, caused him to determine
that as soon as another medical man should come out
to Siam he would abandon medical work. When at
length Rev. D. B. Bradley, M.D., returned after a
sojourn of three years in America and brought with
him yet another doctor, Rev. L. B. Lane, M.D., Dr.
House supposed that his longed-for time of release
had arrived. In that expectation he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“After all, now that my looked-for medical helper has
come, I do not find myself so inclined to give up the
practise of medicine and surgery as I expected to. Indeed,
I believe I verily love my profession more, now
the time has come which I so long ago fixed as the time
when I should most certainly renounce it. It is not such
a burden to me as it once was.... And yet I must have
time granted me for study. My heart is quite set on
fitting myself to preach the gospel from house to house
as a colporteur. Have I not the right to take time for
the study of the language in which I am so sadly
deficient!”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This reaction from his former depression is natural
under the circumstances. Remembering that Dr.
House had had no independent practise before going
to Siam, not even having performed a surgical operation
alone, it is no wonder that the large and varied
number of cases which presented themselves to his
untested skill should challenge his small degree of
self-confidence. But the instant other physicians are
at hand, that mental burden seems to find a measure
of support in their presence.</p>

<p>In the entry of the journal just quoted, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
there appears in the open what hitherto he had not
even written in privacy—another and controlling reason
for giving up his profession, viz.: the desire to
give his whole time to direct dissemination of the
Gospel. First he would devote himself to gaining
proficiency in the language, for the chief purpose of
evangelising. All through his journal in these early
years it appears that his heart was more occupied with
the healing of souls than of bodies. To him the hospital
was a means of gaining intimate contact with
people that he might tell them about Jesus.</p>

<p>Great was his chagrin, therefore, when he found
that the arrival of two physicians was to give no immediate
release. Dr. Bradley had returned with the
intention of devoting himself to unattached practise,
the A. B. C. F. M. having withdrawn its mission. Dr.
Lane, who went out under the American Missionary
Association, which for a time became the successor
of the A. B. C. F. M., would not consent to take
charge of the dispensary until he could command the
language. There was nothing for Dr. House to do
but to meet the exigency of the situation, and this he
did by consenting to hold fixed hours at the floating
dispensary but leaving to Dr. Bradley all outside calls.
This arrangement allowed Dr. House half his time
for the study of the language.</p>

<p>During this period of his connection with the hospital,
in 1851, the smallpox broke out in Bangkok.
Dr. House sent to Singapore for vaccine virus and at
once began vaccinating any child whose parents he
could induce to submit. For weeks he roamed about
the city in his free hours soliciting patients for vaccination,
explaining, entreating, warning, and almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
hiring parents to permit him to inoculate their children.
As one reads through the daily entries of the
journal at this time, he receives an odd impression of
this foreign doctor going about the city begging permission
to administer an ounce of prevention. Back
of this he had two very earnest desires. The first and
immediate purpose, of course, was to save life and to
prevent the dire results of the disease, evidences of
which he saw everywhere. But the deeper motive
was, by the demonstrated advantage of vaccination,
to induce confidence in Western sciences in general
and in the good motives of the missionaries in particular,
so that the people would be ready to give
more serious attention to the gospel message.</p>

<p>After eighteen months of this arrangement, Dr.
Lane took charge of the dispensary and Dr. House
formally abandoned his profession. During the four
and a half years he had a record of seven thousand
three hundred and two patients. With characteristic
unselfishness, however, he consented for a time to
substitute when the other physicians could not respond
to calls; but soon he found that old patients
were taking advantage of this consent by expressing
a preference for him, so that the cases were gradually
increasing. Finally he took a firm stand and declined
to do any professional work, except to assist in
surgery.</p>

<p>After Dr. House had altogether retired from his
profession there appears in his journal a soliloquy
which indicates that another motive had been subconsciously
urging him to this course which, only after he
had some months’ retrospect, had been permitted to
come to expression:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“April 17, 1853. Is it not my duty to write a full expression
of my feeling of my lost confidence in the healing
art to the executive committee. I fear my parents
would be tried when the faculty cast me off as I do their
traditionary notions. Peace with them is better than
war, perhaps. And yet perhaps I am doing very wrong
by standing in the way of some other medical missionary
who would be sent out if I was not believed to be a
regular practitioner.</p>

<p>“But the last consideration does but little trouble my
conscience, believing as I do from the bottom of my
heart, that the more medicine given the worse the patient
is off; and the less, the better.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">When once this idea gained the strength of expression
he freely declared his opinion to his fellow missionaries.
Then we find the curious anomaly of a graduate
in medicine arguing against the use of drugs and
his patients contending for them. However this was
only a passing phase of “unbelief” in an extreme degree,
and his seeming trend towards faith cure had its
own reaction when, a few years later, we find him
having recourse to physicians and drugs when unaided
nature did not bring relief for a wife’s constantly
aching head.</p>

<p>The change from the medical to the evangelistic and
educational form of mission work had an effect upon
Dr. House of which perhaps he was not quite conscious,
but which is quite evident to one who reviews
his life in the foreshortened perspective afforded by
the journal. As manifest in the quotations already
given, the medical profession proved to be depressing
to him because the sense of responsibility in decisions
coincided too closely with his natural diffidence; and
there was a slow but constant ebbing of self-confidence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
Continuance in the medical work was liable to
have lessened his general effectiveness for missions
for this reason. But the more direct Gospel work of
colportage, touring and teaching seemed to harmonise
better with his mind so that he was buoyed up with
hope and inspired with a courage that knew no obstacles.
He had a greater faith in God than in himself,
and the evangelistic work gave the fullest range
to that faith, impelling him to attempt whatever he
believed to be his duty without fear of failure.</p>


<h3>AT THE TRACT HOUSE</h3>

<p>The larger object which Dr. House had in view in
abandoning his profession was to devote himself more
directly to the propagation of the Gospel. His observation
of the physical ailments of the people disclosed
that a large portion of the cases was attributable
to sensualism, brutality or ignorance. This
brought him to the conviction that however merciful
and needful was the work of healing, the Gospel was
of primary importance to remove the infection of sin
which was largely responsible for the bodily sufferings.
When others arrived who with greater relish
took over the medical work, he was eager to give himself
to the Gospel.</p>

<p>But he found himself sorely handicapped for this
work. The urgency for opening up the dispensary
had allowed him no time for careful study of the
language. After two years of constant practical use
of Siamese he was afraid to undertake public address,
for fear his blunders would bring ridicule upon his
purpose. When he terminated his medical work
entirely at the end of four and-a-half years he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
inclined to reproach himself for his defective pronunciation
and faulty diction, a shortcoming which
he never wholly remedied because the tongue had acquired
its tricks through lack of early discipline.
During these years the Gospel fervour in his heart
consumed him with a fury because he could not give
vent to his passion for evangelising. In the arguments
with himself concerning the relinquishment of medical
practise, he always came back to the imperative
need for time to gain facility in the language. So, as
soon as Dr. Lane took over the work of the dispensary,
Dr. House gave himself to a diligent course of
study under the tutorship of Kru Gnu.</p>

<p>The three missions maintained jointly a Tract
House in the bazaar. Upon arrival of Drs. Bradley
and Lane, Dr. House was sufficiently relieved from
the stress of medical work so that he promptly took
his turn at the tract house.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Today I commenced going over to the tract house in
the bazaar to distribute books. It will be long before I
shall feel at ease in this necessarily hurried, confused
mode of trying to do good, but I trust to be enabled to
go through with it. The crowd not particularly unruly,
but Satan put it into the heart of one of them to attempt
to impose upon the newcomer again and again; now as
a Siamese, now as a Chinese, now with and now without
a hat,—to see how many books he could get from me.
This is disheartening.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">An example of another kind of trial in this street
work, Dr. House relates concerning Dr. Bradley:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“A Siamese nobleman told Dr. B. that he had watched
him these many years, had seen him imposed upon every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
way by the Siamese, yet he did not get angry; ‘there
must be something in your religion different from
ours.’”</p>
</div>

<p>The distribution of books in the bazaar had a manifold
value. It not only put the printed word in the
hands of those who did not come to the mission compound,
but it also served to advertise the mission, resulting
in daily calls of a score or more seeking additional
books. The free distribution of tracts in the
bazaar had the advantage of opening the way at once
for a public explanation of the contents of the tracts;
and as these conversations were carried on in the
hearing of a large circle, the propagation of the word
was multiplied beyond the readers.</p>

<p>The men of the mission had devised a unique
method of economising and at the same time assuring
that the distribution should be as effective as possible.
The printed matter was arranged in series. When
any one applied for a book, he was asked if he had
previously had one. If he had not, he was given the
first in the series, but if he had, he would be catechised
to see whether he had read it. If he showed
that he was familiar with the contents, he was given
the next in the series; but if he had not, he was advised
to read the one he had. In many cases the
applicant was able to give a very detailed account of
the Bible story he had read, and frequently asked
questions. This scheme made sure that the printed
matter was being judiciously distributed and that
there was being slowly but surely implanted in the
minds of many people the simple facts of the Bible,
preparing them for fruitful attention to preaching in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
after years. Just recently a missionary magazine told
the story of a woman of Bangkok who made a profession
of Christian faith; and upon being asked
where she first heard the Gospel story, replied that
she first heard of Jesus from a street preacher in her
childhood in the early fifties. The reach of faith in
which those early missionaries sowed beside all waters
was greater than the reach of our imagination to estimate
the harvest.</p>

<p>Dr. House enters in his journal the story of several
conversions which illustrate the extraordinary fruitage
from these tracts carried away by visitors to the
capital. The first of these cases came under his own
personal notice, and the other was related to him by
Mr. Jones, of the Baptist mission:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“A copy of the Chinese gospel of Mark had been
given months ago to a boy in one of the Chinese schools.
He took the book home; it was given to the children to
play with, till only a few leaves remained. A relative of
the man who had married this boy’s sister came from
China, and was visiting in the home of this boy when he
chanced to pick up the tattered book. Reading, he became
interested, and wished to know if he could get
more. The next morning the brother of the boy fell in
with the native assistant of the mission on his rounds
distributing tracts, and invited him home with him to see
the visitor. The inquirer was supplied with the book he
wished and invited to come to the preaching at the
station. He came, grew deeply interested, attended regularly
and two weeks ago was judged a fit subject
for Christian baptism, and received into the Church
[Baptist]....</p>

<p>“At the Baptist mission there appeared one day a man
of sixty years. He had come a six-day journey from
the north. He had never seen a Christian missionary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
but five years ago he came upon a Christian book. Becoming
interested he gathered here and there several
parts of the Old and New Testaments. From these
alone he was led to forsake idols, and became well versed
in scripture—better even than the servants in the mission
compound. He came to Bangkok and sought the missionaries
for further instruction. When asked, ‘Who
has been your teacher?’ he replied: ‘Jesus; He has said,
Ask and ye shall receive, seek and ye shall find.’
Within ten days after his appearance at the Baptist
mission, he fell a victim of cholera.”</p>
</div>


<h3>CANVASSING THE CITY</h3>

<p>Dr. House devoted a part of each day to street
work. He had previously in his walks about the city
prepared an accurate map. He now laid this off in
districts and entered upon a plan of systematic visitation
to every house in the capital. This plan afforded
unusual opportunity to see the people in their homes
and to engage them in religious conversation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“At 1 p. m. went out for a couple of hours distribution
of books. Met at a watt gate two old men. To one
gave books; the other said he was an old man (seventy-four);
his ears were deaf—he could scarcely hear; his
eyes had become dark—he could not see to read; and
what should he do? He seemed to wish to be instructed
in the way of happiness, and I stopped to tell him of the
love of God. Then we walked on together.... I could
not part from him with Christ yet unspoken of, and so
in the road I stopped again, sheltered by my umbrella
only, till I had given him the idea of the Son of God
dying in the sinner’s place. I did not know or care what
passers-by might think, I only thought of the poor old
man’s need of the Saviour.</p>

<p>“My first visit was to a floating house where a Siamese
lady was sitting in the shade of the veranda....<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
She was glad to get books—read fluently; said she already
held to our way of worship, and gave a specimen
of chanting some part of the Roman ritual.</p>

<p>“Next was sent for by a young prince to whose intelligent
family I had given books last week. He gave me
tea, etc. The woman at the next house said ‘Oh, yes, I
would like books,’ and an interesting conversation ensued.
She at once assented to there being a Creator,
and though probably had never heard of one before,
asked for His name. How happy I feel when coming to
one such I tell of the God of creation, and unfold the
wondrous story of redemption.</p>

<p>“At the next house found a clay modeler at work. He
had a book, and brought it to me—proved to be an English
speller. It had a hymn in praise of mother-love,
also a church—, and a Watt’s catechism. The latter I
translated to him, giving me an opportunity to give much
religious instruction.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This type of evangelistic work Dr. House very soon
found to be much to his liking, and was surprised at
his own versatility in religious conversation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I ought to bless God for giving me, as I believe I
have, some talent for entering into conversation with
strangers, introducing the great subject to those casually
met. I was in early youth sensible of a great lack
of talent of this kind, but cultivated it and now I am not
the same I once was.... O, Master, fill my heart with
Thy love, and then my lips must always and to all speak
forth Thy praise.”</p>
</div>

<p>Occasionally he writes out an abstract of the conversation,
especially if it had shown particular thought
on the part of the interlocutor. A transcription of
one of these entries will give a good idea of how the
missionary “preaches”:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Going over into the palace of our prince, found
several Nai, intelligent headmen—one a Khun—gathered
on the porch of the audience hall. They invited me to
sit down and answer questions, ‘talk about religion’ they
said.... Our religion differs in this, for one thing;
whereas your god Buddha was originally a man who by
merit attained to divinity, ours was originally God, who
took on him the nature of man. ‘But what did he do
that he might become God?’ they asked. So I told of
eternity and Jehovah. They asked if we were hired to
come over here; surprised we had no temple with idols;
never was a more excellent opportunity to make known
God’s blessed truth, or more respectful attention—all
friendly, civil. And to many, what I said had all the
interest of novelty.... What were God’s commandments?
Is Jesus then the Son of God? Can a Siamese
man, if he repent, be saved? Can you become God, will
you become a God at last? Why did not God create all
men alike? Why must he needs try us on probation?
In what direction is hell?—these and innumerable similar
questions were proposed mostly in good faith. And
grace was given me and utterance to give what seemed
a satisfactory answer to most of them.”</p>
</div>

<p>On another day, passing through the grounds of a
watt, he was invited by a priest of his acquaintance
to stop for a call. Tea was made ready and a pleasant
discussion of religion ensued in the presence of
several young priests:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“One thing he could not get over, we killed animals.
Yes, so do you, I told him; and explained about animalculæ
in water—promised to let him see them through my
microscope when it came.</p>

<p>“Transmigration endless! He told me that Buddha
taught that if any one took a needle and thrust it into
the earth anywhere in the wide world, and was to ask<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
his teacher if he had ever been there,—Yes, he had some
time or other been buried there! So of any given place
on the earth’s surface. (This beats geology for stupendous
periods of time.)</p>

<p>“Buddha taught that time passed very slowly in hell;
and he illustrated it thus: Now 2,395 years since Gotama
Buddha died—all that time but as half an hour to those
in hell.</p>

<p>“‘Let me see your god and I will believe,’ said some
onlooker. I asked him if he could see his own god?
‘Yes,’ he replied. ‘Stop,’ said my host, ‘you had better
say nothing of that.’ But I went on to ask him if he
worshipped brick and mortar which could not lift its
hand, nor see nor hear.</p>

<p>“They all thought Nippant (nirvana) preferable to
heaven—till I told of the assurance we had that ‘they
go no more out.’”</p>
</div>


<h3>VISIONS OF THE REGIONS BEYOND</h3>

<p>During this systematic visitation, Dr. House obtained
glimpses of “the regions beyond.” Medical
work had already brought him into contact with the
aliens in Bangkok. As he became acquainted with
these groups by his travels throughout the city he
became deeply interested in their home lands. Small
as the mission force in Bangkok was, he began to
meditate whether their efforts should be confined to
the Siamese to the exclusion of all these other peoples.</p>

<p>At that time it was estimated that the strangers
within the gates were equal to the native population
of Bangkok. Chief among these immigrants were
the Chinese. The Chinese held nearly all the trading
in Bangkok. The semi-annual trade winds brought
numerous junks from China laded with Chinese
products; and each of these junks had its cargo of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
human freight also. Sometimes a single junk would
bring as many as three hundred; and the average
annual immigration was estimated at one thousand.
These people came largely from the Island of Hainan,
and nine-tenths of those who sent their boys to the
mission school were from this province.</p>

<p>There were but few Burmese in Bangkok; but of
their old enemies, the Peguans, there was a large village
on the west bank of the river. These people had
originally sought refuge from the Burmese by taking
service under the king of Siam, but in time had practically
become his serfs. It was in their village that
Mrs. Mattoon began her class of children which later
was transferred to the mission compound. The Malays,
few in number, could not be reached for want
of acquaintance with their language. Dr. House
records an anecdote which had come to his ears
showing the shrewdness of these people in their native
country:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The chiefs obtained some Christian tracts. Whenever
a trading vessel arrived, they showed these tracts
to the captain. If the captain swore at the tracts, they
concluded that he was not a Christian, and would have
nothing to do with him. But if he displayed an interest
and inquired about the tracts, they judged that he was
sympathetic with religion and that they could trust him.”</p>
</div>

<p>During the cholera epidemic Dr. House was called
to see the servant of a Cambodian prince living in
Bangkok, and the visit resulted in an enduring friendship.
The prince, the son of the king of Cambodia,
was living in a grand palace provided by the king of
Siam; and Dr. House was led to suspect that he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
held as hostage for the good behaviour of his father,
over whom Siam claimed suzerainty. The prince
urged the doctor to go to Cambodia, assuring him that
he would be welcomed with open arms by the king;
and that the people did not approve of the worship
of images, for the Cambodians held that “God made
man, and man cannot make God.” The information
gained from the prince prompted Dr. House and Mr.
Mattoon to plan a trip into that country. They entered
upon the study of the language for that purpose,
but the death of the old king of Siam arrested these
plans. However, the interest awakened in Dr. House
led eventually to his notable trip to Korat.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most important of these chance
relations was with the Lao. The doctor had early
learned of the frequent trips of boatmen from the
Lao land. With ears open for useful information, he
gathered from a Siamo-Portuguese doctor, who had
accompanied a Catholic priest to Chieng Mai, information
concerning the route, knowledge of the receptive
character of the people and of the deceptive
nature of the reigning prince. His interest in the Lao
grew until he felt prompted to leave the Siamese to
his fellow missionaries and betake himself to the Lao
country. A particular day of indifference to his message
in the streets of Bangkok sent him to bed with
a heavy heart:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“But ere midnight,” he writes, “my sorrow was
turned into joy as the privilege was presented to my
view of yet going a messenger of the glad tidings to the
tribes of the Laos to the north. To them shall my
thoughts be given and my future life, if Providence but
opens the way.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>And again when he was depressed by the fruitlessness
of the early labours he meditates:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I believe all the past of my strange history has been
for a purpose—yet all unrevealed—and I will not trouble
myself about it. May I ever be ready to serve my
Master, anywhere at all times. But should I be permitted
in his Providence to carry his blessed gospel to
the Laos some future day, then I can read and understand
the why of some things. To be thus privileged
were better than to visit the home of my childhood, my
aged parents, my brother, again—’twere better than to
be blessed with houses or lands or wife or children of
my own.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">To him the mission in Bangkok at that time was like
a candle in a starless night, very faint to be sure, but
making more dense the surrounding darkness that
seemed to confine its light. His eyes strained to look
into the regions beyond and his heart beat with passionate
desire to evangelise the unknown peoples.</p>

PROVIDENCE CHANGES PERIL INTO
PRIVILEGE</h2>

<p class="drop-capy">In 1850 the United States sent Honourable James
Ballestier, with a small suite including Rev. William
Dean, a former missionary, as his secretary,
to seek a more generous commercial treaty with Siam.
After three months of bickering with officials he was
constrained to withdraw from the fruitless effort.
The king refused to give a personal audience to the
envoy, whereas the envoy refused to deliver the letter
from the President to any but the king. This point
of etiquette was of vital importance. By refusing to
give audience to the representative of another nation,
the oriental monarch was signifying that he did not
regard the other nation on an equality with Siam. It
will be recalled that Commodore Perry, in seeking a
treaty with Japan, met this same presumption. Even
as late as 1868 China would not admit the equality of
other nations by allowing their envoys to personal interview
with the emperor. Acknowledging himself
vanquished in this point of procedure, Mr. Ballestier
withdrew.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Americans departed when news
was received that a British squadron was on its way,
bringing an embassy to request a new treaty. The
belligerent character of Great Britain at that time was
known in Siam, so that this report sent a tremor of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
fear through the body politic. With a large suite and
a great display of naval force the British envoy Sir
James Brookes met no greater success than the
American. He left in high indignation at the treatment
accorded him, threatening vengeance for the discourtesy
shown to Her Majesty’s communication.
Upon his withdrawal the fear which preceded his arrival
increased to a panic among the officials, who
were terrified at the prospects of war as a result of
the king’s stubborn adherence to custom.</p>

<p>Hand-in-hand with the crisis in the international
relations the affairs of the missions were fast drifting
towards probable extinction. As the intercourse between
the Siamese and Sir James Brookes became
strained, the Siamese began to cut off communications
with the foreign residents. This was only the shadow
of what was to come. As soon as the British fleet
left, a sudden wave of arrests gathered in all who
were employed as teachers at the missions. Upon
inquiry as to the reason, the missionaries were informed
that the teachers were to be punished for
breaking the law in teaching the sacred language Pali
to foreigners. The only plausible ground for this
charge was that the Baptist press had, at the request
of a high official, undertaken to print the laws of Siam
which were in that language. Next the house servants
withdrew from the homes of the foreigners.</p>

<p>Another mark of increased hostility was in connection
with negotiations for a piece of land for the
Presbyterian Mission. Attempts had been made several
times, but the transaction had been adroitly
blocked. Since permission must be obtained for
tenure of land by foreigners, applications were met<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
with procrastination which meant denial, or alternative
locations were offered which were totally unfit
for the needs. Just before the arrival of the two
embassies, a friendly Siamese was found who was
willing to lease a desirable piece of land; official permission
was secured, the money paid over and the
Mattoon family had actually caused their floating
house to be towed to the new location preliminary to
the erection of a building. Just at this juncture occurred
the abortive negotiations for a revision of
treaties. Without explanation or warning, a peremptory
order came from a higher official, revoking
the permit and requiring the missionary to return to
the old location.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances Dr. House wrote home
(Sept., 1850):</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“It becomes a serious question what, as a mission, is
our duty—it now being settled that no change for the
better is to be hoped for. Three and-a-half years we
have been seeking for a place where we could locate
our mission, and in our own way aid in bringing this
heathen people to Christ. But a separate home among
them has been denied and we baffled in every attempt to
secure premises on which we might build houses, gather
a school and lay foundations for those that come after
us. Thus far we have had no local habitation or name
of our own—being merged in other societies, living by
suffrance on their premises.... And now our teachers
are taken from us; no one daring (with imprisonment
hanging over them) to become teacher of the proscribed
foreigner.”</p>
</div>

<p>The status of the mission was deemed so critical
that Dr. House was authorised to report the situation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
to the mission office in New York and to ask permission
for the missionaries to quit Siam as the last
resort and to attach themselves to missions in other
lands. The reply, received nine months later, gave
full authority to the missionaries in the matter, and
provisionally assigned Dr. House as assistant to Dr.
Happer in China. This assignment had been suggested
by Dr. House in his letter to the Board because
Dr. Happer, knowing of the crisis in Siam, had written
him to come to China, adding that he “always
thought Siam an unpromising field; and that after
the Board gets out of it they might as well keep clear
of it.” While waiting for the desired authority to quit
the field the missionaries kept an eye open for a favourable
chance to get away in safety, deeming themselves
warranted in escaping with their lives in any
vessel that could be found to take them away. Thus
did the Mission come very close to an untimely end.</p>


<h3>DEATH OF THE OLD KING</h3>

<p>The serious foreboding of the natives and foreigners
alike was greatly intensified by the rumour that
the king had shut himself up in his palace and would
have no communication with his nobles. Daily the
court assembled according to custom but the king took
no counsel with them concerning public affairs. So
few were permitted to enter the royal presence that
it was difficult to ascertain whether he was sick or
only in a pet as on a previous occasion. It was, however,
a case of serious illness from a chronic disease
which had rapidly become critical.</p>

<p>About the middle of February of that notable year,
1851, the king sent a document to the assembled nobles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
briefly stating that he despaired of recovery, and
left to the council of princes and three chief ministers
the selection of a successor; and at the same time
turned over the reins of government to these three
ministers. Although the king at this time refrained
from nominating a successor, he had some months
previously expressed a preference for a favourite son,
but the nobles would not confirm his wish. Besides
this son there were two other aggressive aspirants for
the throne; all three candidates being conservatives.
While both Chao Fah Yai and Chao Fah Noi had
legitimate claims to the throne there was no apparent
prospect that either would be chosen, for the other
three claimants were strongly united in their opposition
especially to the former because of his known
friendliness towards the English.</p>

<p>As the situation grew ominous of civil strife, the
Pra Klang, the strongest of the nobles and the leader
of the situation, proposed the name of Chao Fah Yai,
having already taken precautions to win to his support
the commander of the army; and let it be known that
any of the pretenders who did not acquiesce would
have to contest their claim with him. By such bold
measures he carried the day, even the rivals reluctantly
giving in their adherence; and on the following
day the decision of the council was communicated to
the Prince-Priest, who gave his acceptance on the 18th
of March. The king-elect remained in his watt till
the death of the king on April 3; he then was brought
to the palace grounds in state and lodged in a house
especially built for a temporary sojourn, and changed
his yellow priestly robes for the ceremonial dress suitable
to be worn until the coronation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>Before being brought to the royal premises, the
king-elect graciously received three of the missionaries
who called upon him, Dr. Bradley, Mr. Jones
and Professor Silsby. No doubt it was to this occasion
that Mrs. Leonowens refers in her book <cite>An
English Governess</cite> (p. 242):</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Nor did the newly-crowned sovereign forget his
friends and teachers the American missionaries. He
sent for them and thanked them cordially for all they
had taught him, assuring them that it was his earnest
desire to administer the government after the model of
the limited monarchy of England and to introduce
schools where the Siamese youth might be well taught in
the English language and literature and sciences of
Europe.... In this connection Rev. Messrs. Bradley,
Caswell, House, Mattoon and Dean are entitled to special
mention. To their united influence Siam unquestionably
owes much if not all her present advancement
and prosperity.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He authorised Mr. Jones to state that “should the
English or American government send an embassy to
Siam now he thought they would be kindly and favourably
received.” He also received the Roman
Catholic bishop, requested him to have prayers offered
in his church for the peace of the country and consented
to have the priests, banished by his predecessor,
recalled.</p>

<p>No believer in Providence can fail to recognise the
hand of God directing the course of affairs in Siam
at this crisis. Had the old king continued to live, war
with Great Britain was inevitable. Had either of the
reactionary candidates been chosen civil strife would
have been precipitated. In either case the foundation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
stones of the mission would have been widely
scattered.</p>


<h3>CHANGED ATTITUDE TOWARDS FOREIGNERS</h3>

<p>In May, 1851, the king was formally inducted into
his regal office under the title Prabat Somdetch Pra
Paramender Maha Mongkut. The accession was
celebrated with prolonged festivities. The coronation
was private, witnessed only by the princes and nobles.
After an interval of a few days came the more public
ceremony of enthronement, and to this the Europeans
were invited:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“We all (except of course the ladies) had the honour
of being present by his own invitation. Indeed we had
a regular audience from His Majesty; a strange and not
a little imposing scene it was in that audience hall of the
palace. A dinner was prepared for us after the European
style, and though ‘he could not shake hands with
us as he desired—Siamese custom not allowing it,’ yet
he sent some substantial proof of his regard in the shape
of a gold flower and one of silver, together with a gold
salung (value one-fourth eagle) and other specimens of
the coinage of the new reign.</p>

<p>“You will understand how marked are these attentions
when you are told that no missionary was ever
before on any occasion admitted within the walls of the
palace, much less allowed to have an audience.... We
were told from the throne in a public audience by the
King himself (who perfectly understands our object in
coming to his land) that he wished us to find ourselves
pleasantly situated in his country and to go on with our
pursuits as we have been doing—‘Fear not!’ he added.
That was the purport of what he said, and though he
was addressing merchants as well as ourselves we knew
he must have had us in mind as much as them.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>Then came the spectacular procession of the king
and nobles around the walls of the palace:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“According to immemorial custom on coronation occasions,
H. M., with his nobles and princes in grand
procession, marched around the walls of the royal palace,
a mile in circumference. We missionaries with the other
Europeans received special invitations to be present....
As the King came along, with pomp and glitter and display
of wealth, sitting high on his throne carried by
thirty-two men, he was distributing right and left to the
crowds showers of silver coins. When he saw us he
stopped to rain silver upon us with a right good will.”</p>
</div>

<p>A month later occurred the inauguration of Chao Fah
Noi as Second or Vice-King. A public pageant only
slightly less magnificent was given, and again the missionaries
with the Europeans were personally invited
and honoured with special attention.</p>

<p>With the accession of King Mongkut a complete
change of attitude towards the missionaries was instant.
The new men appointed to high office were
from the group of progressives. Those who were
carried over from the old régime changed their attitude
with facility, for after all they only reflected the
royal mind. Princes who had eschewed intercourse
with foreigners now courted their acquaintance,
frankly declaring that fear of disfavour with the old
king had formerly held them aloof. Teachers and servants
eagerly returned to their posts. The people in
the streets manifested a new respect for the foreigners.
With great joy Dr. House records the change:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“A new era with us—at least the dawn of a brighter
day. We have a home at last promised us, and on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
really pleasant spot of ground they are going to allow
us to build. With brothers Mattoon and Bush, went up
to visit the ex-prince-physician (now foreign minister)
at his new palace he falls heir to. Were graciously received.
‘I have laid the matter of which you spoke,
before the King. He said he gives his permission for
you to come here (i. e., to site nearby) to live; desires
me to give you any assistance; permits you to build for
yourselves; can have the whole vacant space to the canal
bank, if needed; wishes you to build many houses; about
a thousand missionaries may come if they wish.’</p>

<p>“Almost too good to be true! Are we really then
going to obtain what we have been seeking for in vain
now these four and one-half years—a place to build a
home of our own? A most eligible spot this; none better
in all Bangkok.”</p>
</div>

<p>Permanency being assured, the missionaries decided
to construct houses of brick, making them as durable
and as comfortable as possible. The erection of these
houses required a constant oversight of the work and
attention to details that cannot well be understood by
people in America, for all the practical problems that
the architect or builder would take care of as a matter
of course had to be solved by the missionaries who
had no experience in such work. In the midst of the
enterprise the masons and carpenters struck and it required
much diplomacy to adjust their demands. The
first houses were completed and preaching services
begun at the new compound in February, 1852. This
site continued to be the location of the mission until
1857, when growth of the work necessitated a change.</p>


<h3>MISSIONARY LADIES TEACHING IN THE PALACE</h3>

<p>The most notable of all the friendly gestures was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
the royal request to have the ladies of the missions
teach English to the ladies of the palace. The significance
of this extraordinary move was understood
least of all among these ladies themselves. By his
manifestation of approval for female education the
king swept completely away the argument of age-long
custom against the teaching of women. There continued
to be practical difficulties but the insurmountable
obstacle had been removed by a single gesture of
the liberal-minded king. This notable request is recorded
in Dr. House’s journal under date of Aug.
13, 1851:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Dr. Bradley and Mr. Jones received a communication
from the grand chamberlain of the royal palace, etc.
‘H. M. had heard from Pya Sisuriwong and Pra Nai
Wai that the wives of the missionaries would teach,
changing times (i.e. in turn) the royal girls and ladies,
if H. M. allow. H. M. wishes to know how you will do,
and desires several ladies who live with him to acquire
knowledge in English, etc.’</p>

<p>“Dr. Bradley replied that the ladies of the mission
had made themselves a board of managers of the affair
and were ready to undertake the work. Next morning
Dr. Bradley was summoned to the new prime minister’s,
and told that H. M. desired the teaching in English to
ladies of the palace to begin today—that the astrologer
had pronounced it a good day—and requested Mrs.
Bradley to go at 9 a. m. She did so, her husband leaving
her at the palace gate where the Pra Nai Wai received
her and led her to the gate of the woman’s apartments;
there a number of women were waiting for her. While
waiting outside, the young Princess of Wongna met
her, carried in state under a yellow canopy, and shook
hands with her. She was led to the hall where nine
young ladies from sixteen to twenty (one of thirty)—bright,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
intelligent and beautiful, she described them—were
committed to her as her pupils in charge of the
matron of the palace.”</p>
</div>

<p>The women of the mission who assumed this task
were Mrs. D. B. Bradley, Mrs. Stephen Mattoon and
Mrs. J. T. Jones (who later became Mrs. S. I. Smith).
This work among the women of the palace Dr. House
characterises as the “first zenana work conducted in
any foreign lands,” antedating the zenana work in
India by some five or six years. The number of pupils
at first increased very quickly to twenty-five or
thirty, but after the novelty wore off many of the
ladies dropped out of the class. A few maintained an
interest to the end, and even invited the teachers to
visit them in their private apartments for more serious
work of conversation.</p>

<p>The visits of the missionary ladies to the palace
continued for a little over three years, when they suddenly
and without explanation found admission denied
to them. Some have surmised that the king
became displeased at the religious influence. However
the more probable explanation is that suggested
by Dr. House’s journal where the change in
this order is associated with the temporary displeasure
of the king towards the missionaries by
reason of a letter calumniating his character, which
coincidently appeared in a newspaper of Straits
Settlement and which he erroneously attributed to a
missionary.</p>


<h3>FIRST FRUITS OF THE MISSION</h3>

<p>Along with the turn of the tide in the relations of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
the government there came to the workers the cheer
of gathering the first fruits from the seed of their
own sowing. Though there was no evidence of the
native Siamese being interested in the Gospel, yet the
missionaries were not left without a token that their
work was honoured of God. Two years after the
organisation of the church, a Chinese convert was
received. Under date of Oct., 1851, Dr. House wrote
to his parents:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“It is at last our privilege to write to you of one who,
once a worshipper of idols, is now a worshipper of
Jehovah.... His name is Ooan Si Teng, a Chinese
twenty-four years old, born on the Island of Hainan, has
been here some six years, speaks and reads Siamese and
also reads his native language. He has been living in
the family of Mr. Mattoon for the past two or three
years. From his first acquaintance with us he has been
convinced of the folly of idol worship and has renounced
it.... He accompanied Mrs. Mattoon to Singapore as
bearer for little Lowrie; and Dr. Lane, with whom Mrs.
Mattoon resided while there, says of him that had he
already been a professing Christian, his conduct could
not have been more exemplary.</p>

<p>“So it was with great joy that at our last communion
October 5, we received him to the ordinance of the
Lord’s appointing. The eyes of more than one of us
were filled with tears of joy as we looked on this interesting
scene.... In all probability he was the first
native of that Island to be converted to protestant
Christianity.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">While there was bright hope of the immediate prospects
on the field, from the Mission Board there came
the discouraging reply, “No money, no men,” in response
to pleas for recruits. The reports of the dire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
situation under the old king had not yet been overtaken
at home by the news of the marvellous change
under the new government.</p>


<h3>PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH KING MONGKUT</h3>

<p>As he had intimated, the king could not continue
familiar intercourse with the westerners because none
but the nobles might enter his presence, except by particular
request. There was some speculation, therefore,
as to the attitude he would assume towards the
missionaries after the coronation ceremonies were
over. Any misgivings they may have had were soon
dispelled. For some years it had been the custom of
the Prince-Priest to celebrate his birthday—“the day
like that on which I was born,” as he termed it—by
inviting his foreign friends to a feast. The missionaries
awaited the royal birthday with some interest,
agreeing among themselves that his future attitude
towards them would be more truly forecast by his
treatment of his former custom. When the day approached
the king sent an autograph letter “to all the
white strangers,” inviting them to the palace.</p>

<p>Concerning this event Dr. House wrote (Oct.
18, 1851):</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“This day twelve-month, how different we were situated:
our teachers arrested and in irons; our servants
panic struck or in prison; and we seriously agitating the
question of seeking a more open field to labor in.</p>

<p>“Now we are the invited guests of the King himself,
on the occasion of his forty-seventh birthday, to dine at
the royal palace with other Europeans. His Majesty’s
eldest son is deputed to do the honours of the feast, and
we receiving a present of gold from the sovereign of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
land as a token of his favour; and nobles and princes
courting rather than shunning our acquaintance.”</p>
</div>

<p>King Mongkut entertained a particularly high esteem
for Dr. Bradley and Dr. House. This admiration
manifested itself not merely by including them
under the bestowal of general favours but by marks
of personal consideration. It was no small honour
which the king conferred upon Dr. House by this
request (July, 1852):</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Honoured today by the first personal summons I (or
indeed any of us missionaries) have received to the
royal presence. Nai Poon called to say that he was
ordered some days ago to take me for conversation in
English as His Majesty was ‘losing all his English.’”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Frequently the king sent to Dr. House requesting him
to translate for him items of political or scientific interest
in English journals or to report news from the
doctor’s foreign mail. Before the king engaged Mrs.
Leonowens, the English governess, who served also
as his amanuensis, he occasionally would summon Dr.
House to transcribe in a familiar hand letters in
English to the king or to write for him letters to foreign
rulers, including Queen Victoria and the President
of the United States.</p>

<p>In his capacity as a surgeon, after he had given up
the general practise, Dr. House was on two occasions
summoned to assist Dr. Bradley at the king’s palace.
In January of 1852 he records his first attendance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“At His Majesty’s request—the prince physician desiring
it, Dr. Bradley was summoned to take charge of
one of the royal ladies who had been confined but a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
days before of a princess—His Majesty’s first begotten
since his accession.... Never before had any foreign
physician been within the forbidden precincts of the
harem of the royal palace. His Majesty, like a good
husband anxious for his young wife, desired Dr. Bradley
to invite me to accompany him as counsel in the case.
So in the evening I went expecting to return by twelve
o’clock. Parleying at the inner gate, women servants
opened the gates and escorted us to the palace. Dr.
Bradley had got the fire by which she was lying extinguished
(custom required ‘lying by the fire’), had put
her on a close diet and other treatment. An old lady of
rank waited to carry up my opinion of the case to the
‘Sacred Feet.’ At midnight, finding our patient had no
new paroxysms, as we feared she might, we proposed
going home. ‘Go, how can you; you must stay till morning,
you are locked in and the key sent to the king, so
stay you must; no one goes out till daylight!’”</p>
</div>

<p>Some days after Dr. Bradley received from the
king the following letter of appreciation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">“My Dear Sir:</p>

<p>“My mind is indeed full of much gratitude to you for
your skill and some expense of medicine in most valuable
favour to my dear lady, the mother of my infant daughter,
by saving her life from approaching death. I cannot
hesitate longer than perceiving that she was undoubtedly
saved.</p>

<p>“I beg therefore your kind acceptance of two hundred
ticals for Dr. Bradley, who was the curer of her,
and forty ticals for Dr. S. R. House, who had some
trouble in his assistance, for being your grateful reward.</p>

<p>“I trust(ed) previously the manner of curing in the
obstetric of America and Europe, but sorry to say I
could not get the same lady to believe before her approaching
(threatening) death, because her kindred were
many more who lead her according to their custom.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
Your present curing, however, was just now most
wonderful in this palace.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr1">“I beg to remain your friend and well-wisher,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">S. P. P. M. Mongkut</span>, <em>the King of Siam</em>.”</p>
</div>

<p>In September of the same year the two doctors
were again called to the palace to attend upon the
queen-consort. A still-birth had left the queen in a
precarious condition, so that for more than a month
Dr. Bradley was in almost continuous attendance
throughout the day, while Dr. House took his place
during the night. During this occasion it was necessary
for them to remain in the palace on the Sabbath,
and on that day the two missionaries availed themselves
of a privilege accorded by the king, who agreed
that when it was necessary for them to remain during
Sunday they should have freedom to conduct worship
in the palace.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“There in that hall of the queen’s apartments in the
inner palace, to the interesting group around, Dr. Bradley
read the scriptures ... his auditors occasionally
asking questions, sometimes for information, sometimes
in a carping way.”</p>
</div>

<p>But the queen was not improving; and at her request
the foreign doctors were permitted to leave and
the Siamese court physicians restored to their functions,
administering their medicines prepared from
“sapanwood shavings, rhinoceros’ blood and the
cast-off skins of spiders.” After a day the American
physicians were again called in attendance, and although
they judged the cause to be beyond help, continued
in constant attendance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“September 25. For first time without exception since
Monday, September 13, am to sleep in my own bed at
home—having all other nights slept in my clothes at the
royal palace, relieving Dr. B. who has charge of the
queen in his attendance at night, his family requiring
his presence then.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The death of the queen occurred on the tenth of October.
On this occasion Dr. House was requested by
the king to write a detailed account of the late illness
and death of the queen; and this, together with matter
of his own composition, the king had printed for
distribution.</p>


<h3>A MISSION SCHOOL ORGANIZED</h3>

<p>Having obtained a permanent location, the Presbyterian
missionaries advanced to the long-cherished
project of a school. Under date of August, 1852, Dr.
House makes entry:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“In evening we talked over plans for doing good,
laying out mission work, schools, bazaar schools, a Chinese
teacher. Will go to Rapri to visit our brother
Quakieng.”</p>
</div>

<p>This last sentence refers to the Chinese who had
been received into the young church upon certificate.
He lived at Rapri (Ratburi), a few days’ journey
northwest of Bangkok, where he conducted a school
for Chinese children. A week later the journal records:
“On next Sabbath (15th) Quakieng will begin
to explain the Scripture to the Chinese.” This indicates
the first step forward, a teacher of the Chinese
language introduced as a means of gaining pupils<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
from among the Siamo-Chinese children. From this
time until his death he was fully associated with the
school; and in November he removed his family to
live near the mission compound.</p>

<p>At the annual meeting of the Mission, Oct. 4, 1852,
the journal says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“A superintendent of mission schools appointed; and
myself appointed to that office. Shall have new responsibilities
and important ones; would shrink, but dare not,
cannot—must go forward. Perhaps will find what I
have been waiting for yet. Talked over openings for
starting schools. We all feel as if we are but just
organized—as it were, commencing.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This appointment was after the doctor had fully abandoned
medical practise. The new school started off
with good prospects. In October Mrs. Mattoon began
to give instruction in Siamese language to the eight
boys. The annual report to the Board, prepared perhaps
two months later, gives the enrollment at twenty-seven,
including the four girls in the families and day
pupils; while in January the doctor comments:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Our schools are doing well, but too few pupils.
Geography and arithmetic in the boarding school
(twelve pupils) now fall to me.”</p>
</div>

<p>The use of the word “schools” in the plural is accounted
for by the fact that Mrs. Mattoon had succeeded
about this time in organising a class in the
Peguan village, across the river. But the period of
daily instruction was manifestly not enough to counteract
the influence of the community. Having
through a number of months succeeded in winning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
the confidence of the parents, at length, in February,
1853, she induced them to let their children (mostly
girls) go to live in the mission compound:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“February 9. Tomorrow we expect to have quite an
accession to the number of our boarding pupils—the
whole (almost) of the scholars at the Peguan village,
where Mrs. Mattoon has won the confidence of the parents
as well as the love of the children. Teacher Kieng
reports that their mothers were washing and scrubbing
them as clean as possible today, and their teeth have all
got quite white, so long have they left off chewing betel.</p>

<p>“February 10. And they have indeed come, the little
ones whom Mrs. Mattoon has allured from their mothers,
to take up their home with us. They hardly slept last
night their mothers said and were up early—and yet
some tears were shed.... The mothers came with
them; showed them our school rooms, the new bamboo
bedsteads, the maps—China, Burmah, Ceylon, England,
America. Speaking of my mother—‘Is she yet alive?’
said one of them, ‘now why did you leave your mother
and come to live in Siam.’... Ploi is engaged by Mrs.
Mattoon to prepare their food and to go to bathe with
them.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thus began the first boarding school for girls at the
Presbyterian Mission in Siam.</p>


<h3>DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING PUPILS</h3>

<p>One of the difficulties encountered was to secure
pupils for a period sufficiently long to make the work
worth while. So little did the Siamese parents value
the opportunities offered that they even wanted to be
paid to send their children. A custom of the country
afforded a practical means to obtain and hold pupils
for a period of years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“February 14, 1853. Today an addition to my family
and to my responsibilities. A bright little Taichen Chinese
boy, eleven years old, son of the old Chinese teacher
of Mr. Gutzlaff. The old man is in trouble—a debt with
interest. So he came to us offering to sell the lad, knowing
that the boy would be educated and in good hands.
It is so difficult to secure any other way but by buying
them, boys for any length of time for schools in Siam,
that the end would almost justify the means, were we
to actually buy them, as Siamese masters do. As it was
I had a paper drawn up in which I was to have a boy
for seven years for eight dollars, after which he was to
be restored to the father free—a kind of apprenticeship.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The father was one of the cholera patients whom Dr.
House saved from death. This lad’s name was Naah.
Some nine months later the father, upon his death
bed, gave the boy to Dr. House.</p>

<p>A year or more later, commenting upon this practise
of obtaining boys for the school, the doctor said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“This we find is the best, if not the only way we can
secure the keeping of these native children in our boarding
school. And I do not hesitate to do it when we have
the money to spare. At present have outstanding one
hundred and nine dollars, invested in seven children.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And then he slyly wonders what the abolitionists at
home would say if they heard of this plan of “buying
children” to educate them. In the course of a few
years the boarding schools grew to fill the capacity of
the mission. From the beginning the curriculum included
the principles of domestic economy and manual
training in a practical form. The girls shared in
the house work; the older ones also assisted in teaching
the younger ones. The boys had their allotment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
of work, so that the expense of the school was kept at
a minimum; for the first full year the cost was only
two hundred and eighty-one dollars, exclusive of
Kee-Eng’s salary.</p>


<h3>TO KORAT</h3>

<p>Tired from his confining labours, in December,
1853, Dr. House set out for a tour to the distant city
of Korat, some two hundred miles in a northeast
radius from the capital, but involving nearly twice
that distance of travel. The undertaking had the
approval of King Mongkut, who not only issued the
usual passport but sent a letter commanding all officials
to afford assistance and protection, and directing
the governor of Korat to give supplies and other
facilities as might be required. The journey occupied
fifty-eight days and was made partly by boat, partly
by elephant train and partly by buffalo cart. A party
of five trusty natives accompanied him, including Ati,
his faithful teacher.</p>

<p>Korat, the capital of the province of the same name,
had a population of some thirty thousand. Dr. House
was the first white person to visit the city, at least in
modern times. The out journey was made by boat up
the Meinam to Salaburi on an east branch of the
stream two days above Ayuthia. There elephants
were hired to carry the party with their burden of
books and supplies. The course lay across country
through the jungle and over the mountains, requiring
seventeen days from Bangkok. In reporting home his
safe return he wrote briefly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I have not had time since my return to draw up a
detailed account of all that befell me on the road, but I
think I can promise you an interesting letter next time—that
is, if a traveller’s tale of life in the woods, riding on
elephants (being thrown from the back of one and lying
at the mercy of the huge creature—with those great feet
pawing the air six inches from my head), riding in buffalo
carts, footing it, roughing it; now shooting deer
or peacock, now entirely out of provisions and making a
meal of rice and burnt coarse sugar; seeing great tiger
tracks and hearing their cry, sleeping in the open air by
the watch fire, three nights and four days without seeing
human habitation—with divers other adventures, will
interest you; or if accounts of the glad reception my
books and gospel message seemed to receive in the many
villages and hamlets and in the city, where no messenger
with glad tidings had ever gone before.”</p>
</div>

<p>He was well received by the governor of the
province, whom he had previously met in Bangkok.
Intercourse with the governor proved that the doctor
could not only show him wonders of western knowledge
but could discover to him facts in his own realm
of interests. Salt being a rare commodity and the
local product being coarse and black, Dr. House
showed him how to purify it, greatly to his delight.
As a mark of appreciation the governor had brought
in from the country three unusually large elephants
for the visitor to see; while reviewing them, the doctor
called his attention to a fact of nature concerning
elephants, viz.: that the height of an elephant is equal
to just twice the girth of its foot. His host would
not believe this until he had his men try the experiment
on several animals. The doctor had also found
that the elephant provides a reliable pedometer; as its
walking gait is quite uniform, it is necessary only to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
measure the step of the particular beast (usually
forty to forty-two inches) and then counting the
number of paces per minute (usually seventy) the
distance covered in a given time is easily calculated.</p>

<p>An amusing incident occurred while the stranger
was exploring the city, and Dr. House relates the
story with an evident sense of humour:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Sallied forth at noon to take a walk east of town.
In east gate got into conversation with some citizens;
others came out to gaze at the stranger till soon had a
fair audience to listen as I opened to them the great
truth of the Being of God. An old man sat down on a
stone in the gateway to listen—all was news to him and
others—when a drunken fellow, sent of Satan as it were,
came up and soon became very noisy, till I could only
talk in snatches. Gentle means nor threatenings availed,
but I gave some books.</p>

<p>“Leaving I was going quietly on the way to a watt
outside the walls when my troubler came following after,
noisy and cursing. I gave him that road and took another
in another direction. He returned to follow me,
when I thought I was justified in teaching him that there
was a limit to even Christian patience. So I tripped up
his heels, hoping to walk off out of his way before he
could get to his legs again. But he was only drunk
enough to be impudent, and now angrily followed after
me. I picked up a broken limb and turned to meet my
adversary. Brandishing my rather formidable weapon
in the air over the fellow’s head, I ordered him to wheel
about and march back to the city gate. Many had
gathered in the meantime to see what would happen.
The fellow was frightened at my earnestness, quailed
and marched; soon stopped to plead that he intended no
harm, when I punched him with my umbrella with one
hand to quicken his steps and flourished the sledgehammer-like
limb in the other, and off he marched again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
as bid. This I repeated till getting tired, I tripped up his
heels again and left him sprawling while I went on my
way unmolested.... I cannot even now help laughing
at the figure I must have made with my shillalah swinging
over his head, and his mortal terror at the same.”</p>
</div>

<p>Royal passports were not always honoured at face
value by distant under governors. Dr. House found
that while the king had commanded, the command was
not much more than warrant for him to demand.
After waiting some days for the governor to engage
elephants for the return trip there was little hope of
having his desire granted unless he took up the task
himself. Vigourous action and persistence overcame
the inhospitality which was displayed. The return
trip was laid out through the western part of ancient
Cambodia, through the Chong To’ko pass, thence to
the headwaters of the Bang Pakong River, and home
by way of Kabin and Patchin.</p>

<p>Through this region he met with even great indifference
to the king’s commands:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“On the long roundabout journey home from Korat,
the person of whom I engaged my elephants took me for
purposes of his own far round to the southeast of Kabin,
the point I wished to reach at the head of navigation on
the Bang Pakong River. Not unwilling to see the country,
I put up with a good deal of imposition on the part
of my guide ... one of the greatest rogues I ever met.
At the village where he resided I consented to proceed
with buffalo carts instead of elephants at his urgency.
We had travelled on with them some days when, one
afternoon walking in advance of my party, I entered the
little Cambodian village of Sakao, three miles east of
Kabin on the military road to the capital of Cambodia.</p>

<p>“Here was an officer of the customs who was on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
lookout for some Cochin Chinese soldiers who had deserted
from the king’s service; and they being unaccustomed
to a white face and I doubtless rather travel
worn, and my appearance there unattended being decidedly
suspicious, they were on the point of arresting
me as a “deserter,” when first the name and then the
presence of my guide (who after awhile came along
with my outfit) made all right, for the custom officer
and my guide were old friends.</p>

<p>“Expecting to get away after an early breakfast next
morning, I slept in one of the carts.... Next morning
I tried in vain to purchase a fowl; went over to the
headman to beg him help me. “He had no fowls, he did
not think he could procure any in the village”; but
while he was speaking I actually saw some running
about under the house. I was beginning to think rather
hard of Cambodian hospitality when, induced by triple
price, a man slyly brought me a chicken.</p>

<p>“While I was eating my breakfast, the custom house
officer came over to visit his friend, my guide. Soon a
neighbour brought in a large brass dish, and from the
liquor in it the three quaffed and quaffed again, till they
became very chatty and good humoured. I had finished
my breakfast and the cart drivers were waiting for their
master. But he was too pleasantly engaged to leave the
jovial company he was in. In vain I called on him to
eat his breakfast that we might be off, for the sun was
high, and still three days remained of our journey and
we had already lost much time on his account. “Not
yet, not yet,” he answered, and kept on sipping from the
bowl of arrack.</p>

<p>“Time passed. At 10:30 they were still at their cups.
My patience was now clear gone. To go on I was resolved
and no longer to be defrauded of my time by a
knave. I told him ‘go he must’ or I should go on without
him and he should not receive a penny of the half-hire
to be paid at the journey’s end, and I should report
him to the governor of Korat, who had put me in his
care. ‘And how will you go on without the buffalo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
carts?’ he impudently asked. ‘Do as I did when I went
on to Korat; I will hire carriers here in the village and
walk on.’ ‘Not a man shall leave this place to help
you’—put in the custom house officer, ‘he would forbid
their going.’</p>

<p>“I had said nothing to him before, but now I spoke:
‘Mr. Officer, last night you heard my passport read and
the peremptory order of the viceroy of Korat that I be
not detained a single day on my mission’—and I took
him by the arm as I spoke and looked him in the face—‘You
dare not stop me. Is his excellency the governor
of Korat nobody? I have the royal seal, too—do you not
dread that? Keep me here one-half day more and you
will repent of it.’</p>

<p>“His anger that was written on every line of his
knavish face sobered him. The villagers around looked
on astonished at my audacity, bearding this great man in
his den, and he did not know what to make of it. Just
then, my guide seeing that I was resolute in the matter,
gave in, ordered the buffalos to be yoked and told his
servants to drive ahead, he would follow. I took a
formal but civil leave of the worthy; we were off, and
my guide, running after, soon overtook us. Would you
believe it, we proceeded but three quarters of an hour,
when he drove off the highway to the shelter of some
trees by the side of a swamp and there came to a halt,
pretending it was necessary to feed the buffalos and that
there was no suitable place beyond. So there two or
more hours were lost—and this while one of my servants
was very ill, our stock of provisions all low, and already
seventeen days on a journey that should have taken
but seven.”</p>
</div>

<p>The river was finally reached; the buffalo caravan
dismissed and boats engaged to carry the party to
Bangkok, where they arrived after nineteen days’
travel from Korat.</p>

<p>Two lesser trips were made in 1854, which were of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
some interest. In June, he accompanied the Baptist
missionaries on a trip to Bangplasoi on the gulf:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I had long been promising myself a visit to my old
patient, Chek Chong, the Chinese fisherman whose arm
I amputated five or six years ago to save his life, threatened
by mortification resulting from an alligator bite
that had nearly severed the poor man’s wrist. The loss
of his arm seems to have been under Providence the
means of saving his soul, for the religious impression
he received while in the hospital never left him; he then
expressed himself willing to make our God his God.
Being unable to read and not being able to speak Siamese
at all ... we referred him to our brethren of the
Baptist mission with some of whose church members he
was already acquainted.... After a due season of instruction
and probation they received him to church
membership about a year ago.</p>

<p>“Living some sixty to seventy miles from Bangkok
he cannot often see his spiritual teachers, and would be
quite shut out from religious privilege, were it not that
Bangplasoi has been made a kind of an outstation
by the Baptist mission.... So when I was invited to
accompany Mr. Ashmore to that mission, I readily
accepted....</p>

<p>“While there, Chek Chong told me that ever since he
had lived with us at the hospital he had observed the
Sabbath, refraining from labour. Looking around at
the evidence of thrift about him, I replied: ‘I do not
believe you are the poorer for losing one day’s work in
seven.’ ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘while the fish business has
turned out poorly this season, out of thirty engaged in
it of my neighbours, only four have succeeded at all,
and I am one.’</p>

<p>“We attended morning and evening worship with the
family and such of their neighbours as chose to come in
and listen.... Chek Chong being called on to lead in
prayer, offered up thanks most devoutly that ‘the redheaded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
(<em>i. e.</em>, not black like Chinese) foreign teachers
had come to visit him.’ He seems to have much influence
for Christ; he is not ashamed of our Christ;
two of his nephews are inquirers; the wife puts no
hindrance in his way.”</p>
</div>

<p>The other trip was made in November, when the
doctor explored the Meinam “farthest north” up to
that date, reaching Pitsanuloke and Pichit and occupying
thirty-three days. Some sixty to seventy villages
were visited along the way and more than
thirteen hundred tracts given only to those who
could read.</p>


<h3>CLOUDED FRIENDSHIPS</h3>

<p>The favour of the king was for a time withdrawn
by reason of an incident the character of which was
vague to the missionaries at the time. Later the cause
of the estrangement was discovered to be a letter
which appeared in an English journal at Straits Settlement
in October, 1854. The offending letter not
only misrepresented some acts of the government but
calumniated the character of the king, and insinuated
that he was held in low esteem by the missionaries as
well as by other foreigners. For some reason the king
ascribed the authorship of this letter to a missionary
who had recently passed through Singapore; and
among his officials, as learned later, he threatened to
expel the missionaries except Dr. Bradley and Dr.
House.</p>

<p>The first warning of royal displeasure was the arrest
of the Siamese teachers on the fictitious charge
of teaching the sacred language to foreigners. Then
the missionary ladies, presenting themselves at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
palace gate as usual for admission to teach their
classes, were ignored. The missionaries, essaying to
go out to the sea coast for recuperation learned that
a decree had been issued to limit their movements;
but inquiry received only evasive explanations.
Finally the king sent a demand that the missionaries
collectively should sign a paper disclaiming authorship
of the letter and denying in toto its imputation;
this demand was made before they had seen the letter,
but it gave them an understanding of the trouble.</p>

<p>After consultation they declined to assent to this
demand, partly because it might be construed as an
acknowledgment of responsibility, and partly because
they considered it impolitic to make a general defense
of the government, some of whose affairs they did not
fully approve. However, they drew up a paper denying
their complicity in the publication and reaffirming
their friendship towards the king. After several
months the teachers were allowed to return to the mission,
but with an admonition against giving out “false
information lest the missionaries put it in their letters
and send it out of the country”; the decree of restriction,
however, continued in force for some time. The
servants, returning to the mission compound, reported
the nature of the examination to which they had been
subjected by the king, and Dr. House records the
following: “Being asked which missionaries he
visited in his work, one replied ‘Maw House.’
‘Well,’ said the king, ‘Maw House is good hearted,
affable and good humoured,’ and thus was evidently
satisfied that the unfavourable reports could not be
laid to the teachers.”</p>

<p>Dr. House quietly pursued an inquiry into this matter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
and after some months came to the conclusion
that the instigator, if not the actual writer of the letter,
was a certain Captain Trail, commander of one
of the king’s trading vessels. It seems that while in
Singapore port, one night at eleven o’clock the captain
fired a salute in honour of a ball on shore given by a
friend. The British consul complained to his superior
against the alarm caused by the firing, and his government
forwarded the complaint to Bangkok. The
captain was arrested and cast into a native gaol, which
was crowded with low class prisoners, and was there
for several days before his friends learned of the case.
Some of the missionaries interceded for him and secured
his release. When he left Bangkok he threatened
to get even with the government for his treatment,
and there was good reason to suppose that the
letter was the means of revenge he took.</p>

<p>This entry in Dr. House’s journal was annotated in
pencil several years afterwards, adding “the letter
was doubtless gotten up between Josephs (the Armenian
merchant) and Capt. Eames, a friend of Captain
Trail, with the knowledge of the prime minister,
who was piqued at the king, and whose knowledge of
the state affairs had given the insinuations in the
letter which aroused the king’s hostility.” Fortunately,
time convinced the king of the total innocence
of all the missionaries and in due time the cloud of
disfavour vanished.</p>

SIAM OPENS HER DOORS—MORE
WORKERS ENTER</h2>

<p class="drop-capy">The accession of King Mongkut so completely
changed the attitude of the government
towards foreign nations that the danger of a
clash with England disappeared over night. In due
course of time Queen Victoria sent a note of congratulations
to the new Siamese sovereign and expressed
her desire to send an envoy for the purpose
of revising the existing treaty. Upon receipt of this
letter the king despatched it to Dr. House with the
request to “transcribe it in a plain, legible hand”;
for though the king could read and write English
fairly, he preferred to have letters from abroad transcribed
in a handwriting with which he was familiar,
to avoid misunderstanding. In this connection, Mrs.
Leonowens, who acted as his English secretary some
years later, says that at times the king would insist
upon his own diction in English in spite of warning
of its turgidity, and when his communications of this
character were misinterpreted he would lay the blame
on his amanuensis.</p>

<p>In March, 1855, the English embassy arrived. The
special envoy was Sir John Bowring, Vice-Admiral
and Governor of the English colony at Hong Kong.
Dr. House had, some years before, received a friendly
letter from Sir John through his son John C. Bowring,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
for whom Dr. House was collecting specimens
of Siamese insects; and he looked forward with great
pleasure to a personal meeting with the noted English
diplomat. Again the king sent to the doctor a succession
of notes received from Sir John announcing
his arrival, requesting a private audience, etc.,
desiring these notes to be transcribed; by which
means Dr. House was kept informed of the progress
of affairs.</p>

<p>The reception of this embassy was in marked contrast
with the treatment of Sir James Brookes. The
ceremonies were aglow with friendliness, and the negotiations
were undertaken with the least possible
delay contingent upon the courtesies of the occasion.
The prince who was chief commissioner for the Siamese
sent for Dr. House for an interview; he said that
the Siamese had proposed the missionaries as interpreters
on their side, but this had been declined by
the ambassador on the ground that the missionaries
were Americans.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Soon after [the prince] sent for me, to accompany
him to the conference of the commissioners with Sir
John to discuss the treaty. Found the prime minister
there, who joined in urging me. But I felt constrained
to decline the honour they would do me, feeling my
incompetence to do justice in interpreting such important
matters as might come up; then—‘Mr. Mattoon
must go’—so the prince himself went over for him and
carried him off as a ‘kind of companion,’ he said, not
as translator;—as he did not trust in ** but in the missionary
he did trust. ‘He must be as ears for him’—I
understood him that the king said this last night.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">While negotiations were under way both Mr. Mattoon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
and Dr. House were frequently summoned to assist
the Siamese in the official translation of their counter
proposals into English, even working all night on the
final draft.</p>


<h3>DR. HOUSE AND SIR JOHN BOWRING</h3>

<p>The confidences were not all from the Siamese side.
Sir John Bowring told Dr. House privately that he
had “come with an olive branch in my hand, but
behind me—!” and that he had been reluctant to
undertake the mission but had received letters from
the king urging him to come. The Siamese officials
were so ready for negotiations that they readily
acquiesced in the English proposals; and, apart from
the preliminary ceremonies, the complete negotiations
were accomplished within a week.</p>

<p>In his book, <cite>The Kingdom and People of Siam</cite>,
which gives a detailed account of his mission, Sir
John includes several lengthy memoranda which he
attributes to a “certain foreign gentleman long resident
in Siam.” Many of these are to be found recorded
in Dr. House’s private journal at various dates
preceding the arrival of the British envoy. His narrative
of the scenes attendant upon the choice of
Mongkut is almost verbatim from the doctor’s account.
He highly praises the progressive spirit and
the keen mind of the prime minister, contrasting him
with the usual Oriental diplomat, and adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I learned that on one occasion he sent for a foreign
gentleman whose opinion he greatly valued, and in the
presence of many persons entered upon a dialogue in
which the foreign gentleman was to impersonate J.
Bowring in a discussion of the expected proposals.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Thereupon follows the dialogue in full. The original
of this unique rehearsal in diplomatic combat is found
in the doctor’s journal as a record of his interview
with the prime minister after it was learned that
England was to send a mission. Sir John also accredits
the minister with a confession of belief in one
supreme Divine Being, ascribing his information to a
“certain gentleman”; this confession, Dr. House
says, was made to him personally and acknowledges
in a letter that he had reported it to the British envoy.
The number and extent of these and still other quotations
shows that Sir John Bowring had gleaned much
of his knowledge of the Siamese from Dr. House.</p>


<p>During his sojourn in Bangkok Sir John Bowring
attended service at the mission one Sunday. Dr.
House records the visit, noting that in alphabetical
order it was his turn to preach, and confesses that he
felt a little secret trembling in the presence of the
august visitor. Sir John, in his account of the visit,
adds that the “congregation very sweetly sang one of
my hymns”—for he is the same Sir John Bowring
whose name ranks high in hymnology, being the
author of these hymns, among others: “<cite>God is Love,
His Mercy Brightens</cite>,” “<cite>Watchman, Tell Us of the
Night</cite>,” and “<cite>In the Cross of Christ I Glory</cite>.”</p>

<p>As a broad and deep student of human affairs and
one obviously sympathetic with missions, Sir John’s
estimate of the work in Siam at that period and of the
peculiarly obstinate nature of Buddhism is noteworthy.
Concerning Buddhism he says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“Buddhism by habit and education is become almost a
part of Siamese nature; and that nature will not bend to
foreign influence. The Siamese, whether or not they
have religious convictions, have habits which the teaching
of strangers will not easily change.”</p>
</div>

<p>Concerning the influence of the missionaries he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Much influence is really possessed by the missionaries.
They have rendered eminent services in the
medical and chirurgical fields; they have lent great assistance
to the spirit of philosophical inquiry; many of
them have been councillors and favourites of king and
nobles, admitted to intimate intercourse and treated with
a deference which could not but elevate them in the eyes
of a prostrate, reverential and despotically governed
people.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But concerning the prospects of success for the Gospel
the diplomat is not so optimistic:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I know not what is to impede religious teachings in
Siam, but at the same time I fear there is little ground
to expect a change in the national faith. Neither Catholic
nor Protestant speaks hopefully on the subject.”</p>
</div>

<p>The significance of that statement, written for the
year 1855, lies chiefly in its contrast with the fact of
the certain if slow growth of Christianity in Siam and
the record of attainment to date. Even the keenest
human observer cannot forecast the fruits of the
Spirit’s work.</p>


<h3>TREATIES WITH OTHER NATIONS</h3>

<p>In 1856 a diplomatic mission from the United
States reached Bangkok, seeking a revision of the
existing treaty. The mission was headed by Hon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
Townsend Harris, who, it is interesting to note, came
from Sandy Hill, New York, the home of Mr. Mattoon
and Mr. Bush. The Siamese government was
quite ready to negotiate, for they had the recent experience
to guide them and the English treaty for a
model; and a new treaty was speedily effected. Had
Dr. House been in Bangkok at this time, the Foreign
<ins class="corr" id="tn-136" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: Ministed assured him">Minister assured him</ins> later that the Siamese government
would have asked to have had him appointed
first consul under the new treaty.</p>

<p>In the same year a French embassy negotiated a
treaty similar to that of the English and American.
In one point, however, the French advanced a step.
Sir John Bowring could secure the right for the
English to own lands or build houses only within
twenty-four hours of Bangkok (a very extensible
limit, as time has shown), and Mr. Harris accepted
the same provision. The French, however, demanded
and secured the provision that “French missionaries
may travel to any part of the kingdom and build
houses, churches, schools, hospitals, etc.”; a privilege
which immediately accrued to the Americans by reason
of the “favoured nation” clause in their treaty.</p>

<p>When the ratifications of the American treaty were
exchanged, a year later, King Mongkut issued the
following memorandum:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“We now have embraced the best opportunity to have
made and exchanged the treaty of friendship and commerce
with the United States of America, and we shall
be very glad to esteem the President of the United
States at present and in the future as our respected
friend, and esteem the United States as united in close
friendship, as we know that the government of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
United States must ever act with justice, and is not
often embroiled in difficulties with other nations.</p>

<p>“And if the treaty of friendship between the United
States and Siam has been (shall be?) long preserved in
harmony and peaceful manner it will ever be the occasion
of the highest praise among the Siamese people.</p>

<p class="right">“(Signed) <span class="smcap">Supremus Rex Siamensiium</span><span class="padr2">,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">S. P. P. Mongkut</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>The influence of the missionaries in bringing about
the treaty relation of Siam with the Western world
has been testified by several. The king himself sanctioned
the following statement of esteem towards the
missionaries for their influence on the country:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Many years ago the American missionaries came
here. They came before any Europeans, and they
taught the Siamese to speak and read the English language.
The American missionaries have always been
just and upright men. They have never meddled in the
affairs of government, nor created any difficulties with
the Siamese. They have lived with the Siamese just as
if they belonged to the nation. The government of Siam
has great love and respect for them and has no fear
whatever concerning them. When there has been a
difficulty of any kind, the missionaries have many times
rendered valuable assistance. For this reason the Siamese
have loved and respected them for a long time. The
Americans have also taught the Siamese many things.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the same line spoke the Regent, during the regency
over Chulalonkorn, to United States Consul General
Hon. George F. Seward:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Siam has not been disciplined by English and French
guns as China has, but the country has been opened by
missionaries.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>The recognition of the indirect influence of the missionaries
in facilitating the treaties was acknowledged
by Dr. Wm. M. Wood, late surgeon-general in the
United States Navy, who accompanied Mr. Harris on
his diplomatic mission; stating in his book, <cite>Fankwei</cite>,
that the</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">“... unselfish kindness of the American missionaries,
their patience, sincerity and truthfulness, have won the
confidence and esteem of the natives, and in some degree
transferred those sentiments to the nation represented
by the missions, and prepared the way for the free intercourse
now commencing. It was very evident that
much of the apprehension they felt in taking upon themselves
the responsibilities of a treaty with us would be
diminished if they could have the Rev. Mr. Mattoon as
the first United States Consul to set the treaty in
motion.”</p>
</div>


<h3>A VISIT HOME</h3>

<p>The first decade of Dr. House’s service was drawing
to a close without any apparent need for a furlough,
as need was then understood. He had become
acclimated, accustomed to conditions of Siamese life
and was apparently contented with his bachelor state.
That the tropics had proved to be more friendly than
he had expected, is implied in his frequent expressions
of surprise at continued good health, even assuring
his friends at home that his physical condition was
better than before he left America. But this was not
the common lot of missionaries in the early days. On
the tenth anniversary of his departure from New
York he wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Of the company of the <i>Grafton</i> two already are dead
and three compelled to return home from broken health.
Mr. Mattoon and I alone are left on the field—besides
Mrs. Mattoon, the eighth of the party.”</p>
</div>

<p>The enervating conditions of life in Siam are described
with good understanding by Mr. George B.
Bacon in his volume on <em>Siam</em>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“It is when we remember the enervating influence of
the drowsy tropics upon character that we learn fitly to
honour the men and women by whom the inauguration
of this new era in Siamese history has been brought
about. To live for a little while among these sensuous
influences without any very serious intellectual work to
do or any grave moral responsibility to bear is one
thing; but to live a life among them with such a constant
strain upon the mind and heart as the laying of
the Christian foundations among heathen must necessitate
is quite another thing.</p>

<p>“This is what the missionaries of Siam have to do.
The battle is not with the prejudice of heathenism only,
nor with the vices and ignorance of bad men only; it is
a battle with nature itself.... The fierce sun wilts the
vigour of his mind and scorches up the fresh enthusiasm
of his heart.... Therefore I give the greater honour
to the earnest men and to the patient women who are
labouring and praying for the coming of the Christian
day to this people.”</p>
</div>

<p>When Dr. House parted with his parents in the
New York harbour, it was with the mutual expectation
of never seeing each other again. The separation
was intensified in its realism by the slowness of communication.
His message announcing safe arrival in
Siam did not reach his parents until thirteen months
after his departure. Their response to this message
was one which stirred his emotions to the depths and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
made him oblivious of all around him; it told of his
father and mother and cousins kneeling together upon
receipt of the news and offering thanksgiving for the
beginning of his missionary work. The many friends
who wrote letters to him doubtless never understood
what joy they gave him by their messages. After
receiving a consignment of mail he writes: “Their
letters do cheer, do strengthen, do inspire new resolves,
and make me ashamed of my unworthy
service.” He records with expressions of esteem the
names of those from whom he receives communications
by each mail; and to one who knows something
of the home church these names stand as a roster of
zealous workers, names of families that continue to
the present day.</p>

<p>The affectionate interest of the people was more
than individual; it came to be almost a community
interest. The “monthly concert of missions” saw the
old session house filled with people eager to hear the
latest letter from their own foreign missionary. On
his part he kept in mind the day of these church
gatherings and, allowing for the difference of time,
he estimated that his Monday morning hour of devotions
corresponded with the Sunday evening at home,
and surmised “in our little session room at Waterford
many a fervent prayer was going up for me and
my fellow labourers from those whose prayers will
prevail at the throne of grace.”</p>

<p>It is not surprising that the home church grew
mightily in the grace of giving and developed a generosity
which, long before forward movements, attained
a standard of giving more to beneficence than to their
own work and led the Presbytery in their gifts to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
foreign work. Arthur T. Pierson, D.D., who served
the church as pastor 1863-9 and later became one of
the most powerful public advocates of missions, bore
this testimony to their zeal, on the occasion of the
church’s centennial in 1904:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I owe much of my own enthusiasm for missions to
my six years in this church. It was most active and
aggressive in this department of service. It had its own
missionary in the field, and kept in living contact with
him by correspondence, gifts and prayer. This missionary
atmosphere I breathed with immense profit, and I
was compelled either to lead my people in missionary
work or to resign my pastorate. My real missionary
education began here in a church far ahead of me in
<ins class="corr" id="tn-141" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: inteligence and enthusiasm">intelligence and enthusiasm</ins> for God’s work.”</p>
</div>

<p>No mention of home-going appears in Dr. House’s
journal or correspondence till a letter from his
mother, in 1852, shows her sternly-repressed desire
to see her son:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The Lord has a work for you to do in Siam, and
much as I long to see you I would not call you home
from it. But if health or benefit of mission require it,
I would say ‘Come at once—come home that we may
embrace you once more; and then return with new
vigour to help forward that glorious work which is yet
to be accomplished in Siam.’”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">More than a year later a joint letter from the parents
enlarges upon the subject. First the father writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“When your health should make necessary that you
should have the invigourating influence of a sea voyage
and our climate, you may tax me for the expense, if I
should be spared. If not, I hope to leave sufficient at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
your disposal to relieve your mind from any anxiety on
the subject. I am anxious only for you to be wise and
to adopt the course most likely to prolong your life and
to serve your Master as a missionary. Whether we shall
be permitted to meet again on earth is a small matter
(although there is nothing here that would offer me
more happiness) when compared with the magnitude of
the work in which you are engaged. Therefore I can
say with your dear mother that I cheerfully submit to
the disposal of Him who has crowned our lives with
<ins class="corr" id="tn-142" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: lovingkindness and who">loving-kindness and who</ins> will order all that concerns our
children and ourselves for His own glory.”</p>
</div>

<p>His mother then adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I hope that you will not think because I do not ask
you to come home that we do not desire to see you—we
do indeed long for your return that we may see you in
the flesh. But we cannot, dare not ask you to desert
your post which we feel is one of great honour and responsibility;
and we trust you may be made an instrument
in the hand of God for doing much for the interest
of the Redeemer’s kingdom.”</p>
</div>

<p>Just at this juncture occurred the beclouding of
friendship on the part of King Mongkut. As the
mission work came to a standstill, the missionaries
held a conference to determine their course of procedure.
Dr. House was ready to carry out his long-cherished
plan to transfer his labours to Lao, but the
decree forbidding travel rendered this impossible.
The letter of his parents had insinuated into his mind
the alternative of a visit to America. When he casually
mentioned this to his fellow missionaries they
gave cordial and earnest approval. The expectation
of the early arrival of a recruit to their force removed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
the objection of leaving the Mattoons alone. Then
came the visit of Sir John Bowring, with his eventual
offer of a free passage to Singapore. Availing himself
of this offer, Dr. House left Siam in April, 1855,
and sailed for America <em>via</em> England, reaching home
in midsummer.</p>


<h3>WELCOME HOME</h3>

<p>It was indeed a joyous homecoming. The son had
come again to the embrace of loving parents after an
absence of nine years. He had returned to his native
land after many adventures in a strange country,
little known to the Western world. He had returned
to a church that keenly felt the solemnity of her commission
to preach the Gospel and had high reverence
for her servants that carried the banner. He had
brought back <ins class="corr" id="tn-143" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: first hand knowldge">first hand knowledge</ins> of pagan lands and
vivid memories of personal experiences and observations.
Then a returned missionary was more rare
than even a departing missionary. The Church at
large was eager to see through the missionary’s eyes
the strange peoples to whom they were sending the
Gospel message.</p>

<p>Numerous opportunities came to Dr. House to tell
his story. Large audiences greeted him wherever he
appeared. These opportunities he used especially to
awaken the Church to the importance of the work in
Siam. The periods of obstruction were past. The
treaty with England had just been completed, and the
American government was about to send an envoy to
ask for a treaty. The glowing promise of the sunrise
inspired the hearts of people at home to listen with a
ready mind to his appeal. With great joy he secured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
two ready recruits to go back with him, Rev. and
Mrs. A. B. Morse. Following this visitation to the
churches a new interest in Siam is manifest through
the reports, and there began a series of reinforcements
checked only by the Civil War.</p>


<h3>BELATED MARRIAGE</h3>

<p>During this sojourn in America Dr. House was
married on November 27, 1855, to Miss Harriet
Maria Pettit, formerly of Waterford. The marriage
came as a surprise to most of his friends. He had so
frequently declared that he would never marry that
his change of mind came without warning. His missionary
friends had frequently twitted him on this
subject, but in good part he defended his position.
Usually after these banterings he would enter in his
journal the reason why he chose to go out single and
why he thought best to remain unmarried.</p>

<p>His argument was that it would have been an imposition
upon a woman to have led her into a strange
world, into a primitive state of civilisation, afar from
kin and friends. He persuaded himself that the care
of a wife, the anxiety for her safety and the responsibility
of rearing children would seriously interfere
with his one great purpose, an undivided attention to
the propagation of the Gospel. The Siamese, among
whom polygamy was practised, could not understand
why this one missionary had no wife. Several of the
princes suggested that he take a Siamese woman in
marriage, and one nobleman even offered to provide
a wife for him.</p>

<p>However, there are indications that his arguments
were as much to repress his own idea as to confute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
the bantering. During those years he was a permanent
guest at the family of the Mattoons. He frequently
expresses generous appreciation of sharing
the home comforts of his friends, and confesses that
he did not know how he could have gotten along
without this domestic care of Mrs. Mattoon. Thus
while stoically denying the need of a wife he gratefully
accepts the ministrations of the wife of his
colleague.</p>

<p>Then, after having married and having fully settled
in a home of his own, his real feelings assert
themselves, for he writes, upon return to Siam:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“And mine, too, is a pleasant home, the one to which
four weary months voyaging have brought me, a pleasanter
home than once—for it has a new inmate. Taking
such a partner into the concern is indeed a great addition
to a bachelor establishment.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And a year later:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“You don’t know how nicely we are jogging on in
the good old road of domestic felicity. And when you
hear me say at the end of fourteen months that I am
more fully than ever of the opinion that I have as my
companion in my journey the most suitable one for me
that could have been found had I tarried seven months
or seven years longer in the States, you will allow that,
at least, I am contented with my choice.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He shows the reversal of mind on this subject complete
when, in 1871, he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I must confess that I feel this wholesale sending out
of unmarried women into the field just now so in vogue
in our church is an experiment.... And I do not think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
much better of the sending unmarried young men to
some fields. ’Tis a pity the secretaries of our Board who
ought to know the wisest way do not guide opinion on
this subject and more strongly impress upon candidates
who apply to them the desirableness of making their arrangements
before they leave home—not but what
Providence may bless some favoured mortals more than
they deserve.”</p>
</div>


<h3>ORDINATION AND RETURN</h3>

<p>Another event of personal moment to the doctor
was his ordination to the Christian ministry. Before
his first departure for Siam he had been licensed to
preach, a Presbyterial authorisation necessary to give
the seal of approval to the preaching which it was
expected would be incidental to the medical profession.
But now, having given himself exclusively to
the Gospel work he sought full ordination with its
authority to administer the sacraments and perform
the rites of the church. In January, 1856, he was
duly ordained by the Presbytery of Troy.</p>

<p>Accompanied by the new recruits, Rev. and Mrs.
A. B. Morse, Dr. House and his bride sailed in
March, 1856, by way of England and Singapore, and
arrived at Bangkok in July. The reception accorded
Dr. and Mrs. House was an evidence of the position
which the missionary had attained in the esteem of
the Siamese. He was the recipient of many gifts
from the Chinese and Siamese servants and attendants
at the mission; while a period of two weeks was
largely occupied with calls from the prime minister,
the minister of foreign affairs, several of the princes,
many of the old friends among the nobles, the old
teachers and a multitude of native friends at large.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
The welcome was so spontaneous that it gave evidence
of a genuine honour, and of an appreciation of the
years of service rendered by the doctor higher than
he had imagined the people felt.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most signal token of esteem on this
occasion was shown by King Mongkut. No advance
notice of the arrival of Dr. House and party having
been received, their appearance at the customs house
some miles below the city was a surprise, which in
some manner was quickly heralded to the king, so
that when the party approached the city, officials
were waiting to receive them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Before we got to our own landing our friendly
neighbour, H. R. H. Prince Kromma Luang Wongsa,
hailed us, and we must needs land at his place. Shaking
of hands was not enough, but his arm was offered in
English fashion ... and thus escorted by the leading
prince of the kingdom was Harriette conducted to her
future mission home, Mr. Mattoon and I following....
And soon our native church members and teachers
and the school children came flocking around.</p>

<p>“But the king had heard of my arrival and the prince
had a message from him for me that he was waiting to
see me at the palace. So, thither I must go—the prince
took me in his own boat. Some public ceremony was
going on, and the whole court was assembled at the river
house in front of the palace. The king, on a lofty platform
handsomely roofed over, by the water edge; while
yet at a distance he saw me and called out my name,
inviting me to ascend the steps that led to his pavilioned
seat, when he shook hands cordially. His Majesty spoke
of the letter he had received from me while away. Then
he said, ‘Your wife has come with you!’—and then
turning to his courtiers added, ‘Formerly Maw House
declared he would not have a wife, and now he has
taken one.’ ‘Oh, your majesty,’ I replied, ‘wisdom has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
come to me and I have changed my heart in that matter,’
which made them all smile.</p>

<p>“He then said my wife must come and visit the royal
palace. He had missed me very much. I must come and
live near him. Turning to one of his ministers he said,
‘He guessed they must build a house over there’ (pointing
out a spot near the palace). I must take an office
under the government. The prime minister told me I
must become a Siamese nobleman.”</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. House and Mr. Mattoon were sent for again by
the king a few days later, and availed themselves of
this occasion to present to His Majesty several useful
presents sent out by American admirers.</p>


<h3>TOURS WITH MRS. HOUSE</h3>

<p>While in America, in 1855, the Sunday school of
his home church provided funds for the purchase and
outfitting of a boat for touring. The result was a
boat equipped for the work, affording more comfort
than possible in the native boats. Along the side of
the small cabin, lockers were fitted, serving both as
seats and place for storage. A removable table between
afforded space for writing or eating. For the
night an extension bridged the space between the
lockers, and this, covered with cushions, made a
comfortable double bed. In December of 1856 Dr.
House made the first tour with Mrs. House. Customs,
and scenes in Siam had by this time grown
so familiar to him that his letters home do not
contain details as did his earlier letters. Their first
tour together, in company with some of the other
missionaries, was up the Meklong River in western
Siam as far as the town of Kanburi amidst some fine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
mountain scenery. Several other trips occurred; one
of them to Petrui:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“A fortnight or more,” he writes, “exploring some
of the totally unvisited districts of the eastern portion
of the plain which constitutes central Siam—you know
my passion for penetrating into remote and unexplored
regions and out of the way places.”</p>
</div>

<p>If perchance this enthusiasm conveys the impression
that these journeys were of unmingled pleasure
and simple romance it is well to have that fancy
checked by some material facts; for, continuing the
narrative of this trip, the doctor writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Upon review of the tour I can recall but few that I
remember with more satisfaction. But for pleasure—I
cannot say much for a tour. Our confined quarters
(cabin five by seven), the rocking of the boat with
every movement of ours or of the boatmen, the hot sun
upon the roof and sides by day and the myriads of mosquitos
as the evening comes on (and such ravenous
merciless mosquitos, too), the monotony of the scenery
on the lower stream and absence of all that is pretty or
picturesque in the villages and houses of the natives,
and last but not least the universal uproar among all the
dogs whenever one steps ashore anywhere in their villages—all
detract largely from the romance and not a
little from the comfort of a mission tour in this
country.”</p>
</div>


<h3>MARKS OF GROWTH</h3>

<p>Dr. House continued to be superintendent of the
mission school after his return in 1856, and although
he makes very few references to this work in his
journal from now on, yet there are occasional items<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
which mark the growth. From this period Mrs.
House appears as a factor in the educational work,
but her achievements will occupy a separate chapter.
In August after the return the doctor writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Our school is much enlarged—many applicants to
learn English. The eldest child of the son of the Prime
Minister now comes regularly to Mrs. Mattoon, a very
bright lad of seven. At the request of the king I am
teaching two princes; one of sixteen, his grandson, the
other a grandson of the late king, a boy of eleven. And
by order of H. M. a dozen of the sons of his servants
are now learning English in our school as day scholars....
There is a spacious bamboo school house going
up in the back part of our lot.”</p>
</div>

<p>This growth, however, was in the educational work.
While the workers did not belittle the importance of
the school, they were well-nigh sick of heart with
deferred hopes, a feeling that is reflected in their
report to the Board for the year 1856:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“It requires no little faith to conduct, day after day
and year after year, these patient labours; especially as
they have not resulted in the conversion of those on
whom time, talents and prayers of the missionaries are
spent.”</p>
</div>

<p>This increase in school was so rapid that shortly
after they had established themselves on the site
granted by the king it became evident that this lot in
the city would not allow for the expansion commensurate
with the growth. With the awakening of
a desire for education and of an interest in the foreign
religion the earlier necessity of having a location
within the city itself had passed, for what the mission<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
had to offer was being sought after. Accordingly, a
parcel of ground, the gift of Mr. D. O. King, was
obtained on the west bank of the river in the lower
suburbs known as Sumray. There new buildings
were erected, and in November, 1857, the transfer of
the mission was effected to that site, which became
the scene of the most notable achievements of the
mission in Bangkok and continues to the present day
the center of a pervasive Christian influence.</p>

<p>At the end of the first year in the new location, Dr.
House wrote home: “School occupies me much of the
time. We have a new Siamese teacher, a most respectable
old gentleman; may he get good from us,
saving good.” This teacher was Nai Chune, who, a
year later, became the first Siamese convert. The
significance of this addition to the teaching force is
that the pupils are no longer predominantly Chinese
lads, but that the demand for teaching the Siamese
language requires a native teacher.</p>

<p>The winter season, being free from rains, was the
time best suited for touring in the country. In February
of 1858 Dr. and Mrs. House started up the
Meinam to revisit the scenes of their former tour.
Finding the river alive with pilgrims going to Prabat
for the annual veneration of Buddha’s footprint, they
decided to join the pilgrimage as affording an excellent
opportunity for distributing tracts. On this visit
to the shrine the visitors did not experience the same
opposition to entering the sanctum as Dr. House had
on his first visit.</p>


<h3>A PRESBYTERY ORGANISED</h3>

<p>The recruits to the mission force so far had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
temporary additions only. Owing to the death of his
wife, followed by the failure of his own health, Mr.
Bush was compelled to resign after four years. Mr.
Morse, who went out upon Dr. House’s return, was
forced to give up within two years by reason of
health. At the end of ten years there had been only
one net increase in the mission force, Mrs. House. In
1858 two men arrived who became important factors
in the work, Rev. Daniel McGilvary and Rev. Jonathan
Wilson, with his wife. When the announcement
was received that these two men had been commissioned,
Dr. House wrote home:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“These two friends became interested in Siam mission
at the time of my visit to Princeton. If they reach
us, I shall have new reason to bless the heavenly Guide
who led me almost unwillingly back to my native land.”</p>
</div>

<p>The doctor’s estimate of the reflex benefit to Siam
from that trip to America was all too modest; for
that visit was the beginning of an ever increasing interest
in that country on the part of the church and of
a constantly enlarging supply of men and money.
Concerning this visit to Princeton, Dr. McGilvary
says in his Autobiography:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I was entering upon my senior year when it was announced
that Dr. S. R. House, of Siam, would address
the students. Expectation was on tip-toe to hear from
this new kingdom of Siam. The address was a revelation
to me.... My hesitation was ended....</p>

<p>“The call found Jonathan Wilson and myself in much
the same state of expectancy, awaiting for a clear revelation
of duty. After anxious consultation and prayer
together and with Dr. House, we promised him that we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
would give the matter our serious thought; and that if
the Lord should lead us thither we would go.”</p>
</div>

<p>With the increase of ordained men on the field, the
time seemed ripe to associate themselves together in
the official relationship of a Presbytery. At an informal
meeting in the summer of 1858 the following
call was issued:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Whereas, in the providence of God there are now in
the mission a sufficient number of ordained ministers to
constitute a Presbytery and as it seems expedient that
we, cut off as we are from the privileges and oversight
of our respective Presbyteries, should meet together
from time to time in a formal public capacity as a
judicatory of the Church of Christ to consult for her
best interests in this our field of labour; and hoping
that it may be beneficial to ourselves and the Church
at large,</p>

<p>“Therefore, Resolved, That in accordance with the
resolutions of the General Assembly held in Baltimore
in May, 1848, making provision for ‘the formation of
Presbyteries by the action of missionaries in foreign
fields’ a Presbytery be constituted at Bangkok on the
first day of September next, to be called the Presbytery
of Siam and to be composed of the following persons,
viz.: Rev. Stephen Mattoon and Rev. S. R. House, of
the Presbytery of Troy, New York; Rev. J. Wilson, of
the Presbytery of Beaver, Pennsylvania, and Rev. Daniel
McGilvary, of the Presbytery of Orange, North
Carolina; and that said Presbytery be opened by a sermon
by Rev. S. Mattoon, the oldest of the ministers of
the mission; and</p>

<p>“Resolved, second, That the day of the opening of
the Presbytery be observed by the members of the mission
as a day of special prayer for the blessing of the
Spirit of God upon us, and that a special meeting for
prayer be held at 9 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>At the appointed time the Presbytery of Siam was
formally organised, Rev. Samuel R. House being
chosen first Moderator and Rev. Daniel McGilvary
being elected Stated Clerk. Mr. Mattoon, who was
about to take a furlough in America, was appointed
the first commissioner to the General Assembly, to
meet in Indianapolis the following spring. Here,
again, as in the organisation of the first church, the
missionaries were taking a step in anticipation of the
fruit of faith more than in actual need. Two of
the very important functions of a Presbytery are to
oversee the churches and to ordain candidates for the
ministry. But there was only one church in Siam at
the time and there were only two “native” members
on the roll; and a Presbytery could add little to the
fellowship of the missionaries except the formalities.
However, the workers in the field were certain of the
harvest and in simple faith they went about setting up
the organisation for the proper care and nurture of
the native churches that were yet to be established.</p>

<p>In December of 1858, when the dry season had returned,
Dr. House, accompanied by Mr. McGilvary,
made a twelve-day tour up the Meinam, commencing
labours at Angtong and continuing as far as Bansaket.
The results of the tour were unusually
hopeful:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“In two or three instances it did seem as if the Spirit
had prepared their hearts to welcome the doctrine of
Christianity.... I could not but say to my good
Brother McGilvary, who as well as myself was struck
with the deep interest manifested, ‘Surely there must
be much prayer going up for us here in Siam.’ Tears
would come in my eyes as I solemnly urged them to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
leave their refuge of lies and trust in a living Saviour,
ready and mighty to save. And on their part they desired
to know, not how they might make merit (the
usual question of Siamese), but what they were to do to
secure the salvation, the news of which then for the
first time reached their ears. It seemed like the dawning
of a better day.”</p>
</div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IX">IX<br />
FIRST THE DAWN, THEN THE DAYLIGHT</h2>

<p class="drop-capy">In the annals of missions much has been made of
the long years of patient labour before a first
convert was gained in other lands. It is written
of Judson that he preached the Gospel six years in
Burma before a native made confession of the Christian
faith. Morrison patiently taught the Gospel
seven years in China before he was rewarded with
one disciple. The Telegu mission in India is described
as one of the most remarkable in the history
of missions in the contrast between the first long
fruitless period and then the rapid growth; and in
confirmation it is cited that “at the end of two decades
only one native assistant could be reported, one
church with nine members and two schools with
sixty-three pupils.”</p>

<p>But in Siam, from the time Dr. Gutzlaff arrived
until the first enduring convert from among the Siamese
was gained, thirty-one years elapsed. It is true
that during those years much of the energy of the
other missions had been directed toward the conversion
of the ex-patriate Chinese, from whom there had
been an encouraging response; none the less, the
Siamese were also the object of constant prayer and
faithful wooing. From the time that Dr. House and
Mr. Mattoon reached Siam to devote themselves particularly
to the winning of the Siamese, twelve years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
and six months passed before one lone Siamese renounced
the faith of his fathers and acknowledged the
Christian religion to be the truth. These wearisome
years of waiting were lengthened in their tediousness
by the chagrin of having impostors simulate conversion
for iniquitous ends.</p>

<p>The story of this remarkable first native convert is
best given by Dr. House in his own way. First under
date of March 6, 1859, he writes home of the promise
of the first-fruit:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I have had a long talk with Nai Chune. Since the
fourth month of last year he has been convinced of the
truth of Christianity. He has broken the necks of his
household gods and melted them. ‘If I think he venerates
the gods still he will go into the temple and do the
same.’ Those stories in their sacred books about its
raining diamonds and gold he regards not like the
beneficent miracles of Christ which I told him.</p>

<p>“I was going to give him some idea of the historical
evidences when he cut me short by saying, ‘I have <em>tried</em>
Buddhism—and what benefit has it been to me? I have
thrown away a large part of my life in studying it. But
I was a child then—God must forgive me.’ He has
ceased to gamble and to drink spirits, to both of which
he formerly was addicted. He says that he sometimes
weeps with joy when he thinks of God’s goodness to
him. He prays to Jehovah, keeps the Sabbath, and for
months has been a faithful attendant on preaching, to
which he often invites his acquaintances, bringing them
with him.</p>

<p>“He is an educated man of about forty years, has a
wife but no living children. He was once a priest, in
the king’s own watt for some eight years. At one time
he used to call upon me often and learned several chemical
experiments. Since the mission moved to its new
location in his neighbourhood (where he has a small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
property) he called to renew acquaintance. I had much
conversation with him formerly about religion; but he
seemed almost too willing to believe. I mistrusted his
motives, past experience having made me too cautious
perhaps. When he called subsequently I had no confidence
in his sincerity. Mr. Mattoon, however, thought
somewhat better of him.</p>

<p>“He is now the Siamese teacher of our school, and is
very faithful to his duties. The most interesting feature
of his case and what, with other things, has removed
my doubts, is the true moral courage with which he
avows his change of his belief to his countrymen and
relatives. I do not think anything but the grace of God
could make a Siamese brave enough to do this.”</p>
</div>

<p>Five months later, the doctor records the reception
of the convert into the Mission Church on Aug.
7, 1859:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“My eyes have at length been permitted to see what
has long been my heart’s desire and prayer to God, the
baptism of a Siamese. Nay, to my unworthy hands has
this privilege fallen, to receive into the visible fold of
Christ by the ordinance of His appointing this new
member of the flock.</p>

<p>“For over twelve years of hope deferred has this
great blessing been sought and prayed for, but ‘sought
and never found’ till now. Blessed be the name of Him
who in His mercy and sovereign grace has been pleased
to visit us with His favour and make the teaching and
preaching of His servants here the means at last of
bringing one heathen soul out of nature’s darkness into
the light and peace of His kingdom.</p>

<p>“Nai Chune, a Siamese, an educated man of nearly
forty years of age, after a satisfactory examination on
his views and experience was today received to our fellowship
by baptism in the sacred name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost. May he walk worthily of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
the name he has named today, and be a witness for
Christ his God and Saviour among his countrymen. He
appears remarkably well. He is courteous and intelligent,
a true Siamese gentleman in manners; is serious-minded,
sedate, seems to realise the goodness of his
Heavenly Father to him.”</p>
</div>

<p>The joy of this conversion was soon followed by a
shadow of sorrow. For a little more than three
months later occurred the death of faithful Quakieng.
Fortunately the work among the Siamese had developed
so favourably that less emphasis was being
placed on the instruction in Chinese; and in a sense
Nai Chune took the place of Quakieng, but with a
transfer of the major effort to the teaching of the
Siamese language.</p>

<p>During this year King Mongkut had finished a new
grand audience hall in connection with the palace,
fashioned partly in European style. At the opening
of the hall the king gave a feast to which many of
the European and American sojourners were invited,
among whom were Mr. and Mrs. House. In a letter
to his father the doctor tells privately of a proffer of
honour and service made to him by the king: “H. M.
said, ‘You with your wife must come and live here
[at the palace] and have the young princes, my children,
for your pupils.’ I excused myself, my hands
being already full.” With the cessation of teaching
by the missionary ladies in the palace, the king had
engaged an English lady, Mrs. Leonowens, as a tutor
for some of the inmates of the palace, including his
sons. Apparently, however, her teaching duties diminished
after a time and she was occupied chiefly as
an amanuensis for the king, and she was still connected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
with the palace at the time the king made this
request of Dr. House.</p>

<p>Whether the king had serious intent in this proposition
it is difficult to judge; but the suggestion does
indicate that he still held Dr. House in high regard
and that his estimation for Western education had not
waned. The mission school by this time had become
a well-established, well-organised institution, the management
of which required the full attention of the
doctor. His original term of service as Superintendent
continued until 1861, when relinquishment of
the office was apparently due to the fact that he was
appointed to open a new mission station at Petchaburi.</p>


<h3>NEW STATION AT PETCHABURI</h3>

<p>Although the work at Bangkok had been steadily
growing, no extension of the field was undertaken until
1861, when a station was opened at Petchaburi, where
Dr. House and Mr. Mattoon had made several visits.
In that year two new missionaries with their wives
had come out in company with Rev. and Mrs. Mattoon
on their return from furlough in America; these
were Rev. S. G. McFarland and Rev. N. A. McDonald.
Of the many places where the missionaries had
visited with the hopes of one day establishing a local
work, Petchaburi then seemed the most favourable
because the acting governor had personally solicited
the missionaries to provide teaching of English; and
had offered, on condition that they would teach his
son the language, to provide a place for their school.</p>

<p>The Mission had voted to assign Dr. and Mrs.
House to establish the new station. The doctor visited
the field, procured a lot and made ready for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
work, and then returned to bring his wife. But the
day before their departure, the doctor had the misfortune
to fall from a horse, sustaining injuries which,
at the time, it was feared would prove to be permanent.
Under these circumstances the mission changed
the appointment, and sent instead Revs. Daniel McGilvary
and S. G. McFarland with their wives, who
thus became the first occupants of the new mission.</p>

<p>At this point it will be interesting to note that in
his journal, in 1861, Dr. House records that the missionaries
had felt constrained to ask the Board for an
increase in salary from the prevailing six hundred
dollars to seven hundred dollars, giving as a reason
that the cost of living had greatly increased since the
country had been opened to Western commerce, so
that articles of provisions had in some cases increased
as much as one hundred per cent. Dr. House himself
had received a patrimony at the death of his father,
which he used not only to supplement his salary for
living expenses, but very generously for assisting in
the work of the mission. Entries in the journal indicate
that he had undertaken, at his own expense,
repairs and enlargement of the mission house in which
he lived.</p>


<h3>THE REMARKABLE STORY OF NAI KAWN</h3>

<p>Within a month after the new station at Petchaburi
was opened, the missionaries reported the extraordinary
case of a Siamese who had come to believe upon
God and Christ through portions of the Scripture
that had come into his hands, although he had never
seen a missionary and had never met a Christian.
The name of this man was Nai Kawn. Writing to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
his family in America under date of July 17, 1861,
Dr. House quotes in part from a letter which Mrs.
McFarland had written to Mrs. House giving the
story; and in part from Mr. McGilvary:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I wish Dr. H. could be here to examine a ‘diamond’
we have found here (<em>i. e.</em>, a native of Petchaburi, which
name means ‘city of diamonds’). We do believe it a
true, genuine diamond, and though it needs to be polished
it will one day shine in our Saviour’s diadem in
glory. It seems an extraordinary case in many respects.
The man is a middle aged Siamese, resides about five
miles from Petchaburi capital; had never seen a missionary,
but some of our Christian tracts and portions
of the Scripture—which he had got from his neighbours—appears
to have been the means of enlightening his
mind and converting his heart. He had taught his little
boy the Lord’s prayer and the ten commandments.”</p>

<p>“Mr. McG. writes: He certainly has the clearest idea
of the Scripture of any heathen convert I have met with.
He literally knows John, Acts, Romans (all the Bible he
has yet seen) by heart; can repeat whole chapters without
missing a word. He evidently studied for months
and years.... Seems delighted to find us, as if his
highest wish had been realised. Wishes to come and
live with us at once to learn more perfectly the Gospel,
and to assist to teach and distribute books. To try his
sincerity, no encouragement was offered him, fearing
he might wish support from the missionary. ‘Oh, no,—he
wished no compensation, as he had enough to live
on.’ He has a few hundred ticals and wants no more.
He has settled one son with three hundred ticals, and
the other son he has just left with us where he can be
taught the Christian religion. Says he would not give
up the new religion for the offer of being king of Siam.
Comes to worship, walking five miles over muddy roads.
Longs to see another Siamese Christian—has hunted all
over to find one.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>In the fall of that year Dr. and Mrs. House were
obliged to spend several months in Petchaburi to relieve
the McFarlands, who went to Bangkok for
medical attendance. During that sojourn the doctor
had several conversations with Nai Kawn; and in
letters to his brother in America narrates the confession
of that remarkable convert:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Doctor, the Siamese think only of getting a living.
That they must have nor always are they very scrupulous
as to the means they resort to. Before—in the days
of my sinfulness—I was so too. Then I had not reflected
upon, was not attentive to my condition. I saw
myself a sinner; when I became conscious of this, the
Lord Jesus Christ was pleased to forgive me.</p>

<p>“My wife formerly—when I began to talk in the
house with those that came to see me about the religion
of Jesus—would go away, stop her ears, would say ‘I
won’t hear it,’ and off she would go. Now she says
nothing, listens, sometimes says there is good in it; will
hear me when I pray in the room at night.</p>

<p>“I remonstrated with my neighbours but, Doctor,
they are wilfully set in their wickedness. But, Doctor,
we cannot make them repent. It is only those whom
God pleases to choose.</p>

<p>“They tell me that when the king hears that I have
become a disciple of Jesus I shall be whipped. I tell
them, if he kills me I care not. If the Lord gives me to
die, I must die as the Lord willeth. But while I live, I
must bring forth fruits to offer Him.”</p>
</div>

<p>Nai Kawn was never formally enrolled in the
Church. He had found the acme of joy and of liberty
in the Gospel before he knew of the church as an
organisation. The witness of his conduct, the testimony
of his lips and the evidence of his fellowship
with Christians was more vital and compelling than a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
formal profession of ecclesiastical relationship. The
honour of having been the first native at Petchaburi
to become a member of the Church was gained two
years later by Nai Kao.</p>

<p>Another honour of primacy in the profession of
religion was attained at Bangkok in 1861, when Maa
Esther became the first Siamese woman to unite with
the Church of Christ. She had been given, a poor
sick child, to Mrs. Mattoon by her father at an early
age; and had been adopted and reared by Mrs. Mattoon.
She had accompanied her foster mother to
America in this same year. Maa Esther has continued
a faithful, consistent Christian all these remaining
years, and has been a zealous worker for the
cause of Christ.</p>

<p>What was the final evangelising tour by Dr. House
was taken in 1862, when, accompanied by Rev. N. A.
McDonald, who had lately joined the mission, and
Rev. Robert Telford, who was maintaining the Baptist
work among the Chinese in Siam, he made a trip
along the eastern coast of the gulf as far as Chantaboon.
The responsibility for the school, together with
the condition of Mrs. House’s health, made it inconvenient
for him to continue this phase of the work
which he greatly enjoyed.</p>


<h3>PERIOD OF THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR</h3>

<p>During the Civil War in the United States the mission
was not very seriously affected by the conditions
of the home church. Except for the first injunction
from the Board against enlargement of the work and
for the exceeding high rate of bank exchange, Dr.
House gives no indications of adverse results on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
field. Although the missionaries then in Siam were
from both sections of the divided fatherland, they
continued to live in cordial relations. During this
period several reinforcements reached Siam, showing
that the church at home had not allowed the war to
curtail their work entirely. These additions were:
Rev. and Mrs. C. S. George (1862), Mrs. F. F.
Odell (1863), Rev. and Mrs. P. L. Carden (1866).
On the other hand, the mission suffered the serious
loss of Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Mattoon, who were constrained
to resign in 1865 on account of Mrs. Mattoon’s
continued ill health.</p>


<h3>SECOND FURLOUGH</h3>

<p>Dr. House left Siam only twice during his twenty-nine
years of service. After a second period of
seven-and-a-half years of labour, he sailed for
America on a furlough in February, 1864. Even then
the leave was taken not so much on his own account
as because of Mrs. House’s urgent need of recuperation.
Since they left America, both of Dr. House’s
parents had died. He made the second journey at his
own expense. At this time the Civil War in America
caused the rates of exchange to be very high; to avoid
this high rate, Dr. House accepted a loan of one thousand
dollars from the king’s private treasury, giving
only his personal note as security; and of this sum the
king authorised Dr. House to pay over to the widow
of Rev. Jesse Caswell, in America, five hundred dollars
as a further token of appreciation of his
former tutor.</p>

<p>The journey home was made by way of the Red
Sea, Palestine, Egypt, Paris and England. Inclusive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
of the travel, their absence from Siam covered
two years and ten months. The return trip was made
by way of the Pacific, leaving San Francisco Sept. 9,
1866, thus for the first time completing for these two
the circumnavigation of the globe. On the way out a
stop was made at the Hawaiian Islands. The travelers
reached Hong Kong Nov. 4, and while waiting for
a vessel to continue their voyage they went up to
Canton, where they were most friendly received and
hospitably entertained by the family of Mr. S. E.
Burrows, the head of a great commercial and shipping
firm of that place. The Burrows extended to
Dr. and Mrs. House a free passage in one of their
own vessels which was sailing direct for Bangkok,
and there they arrived Dec. 16, 1866.</p>

<p>Again the returning missionaries received a warm
welcome on the part of their many native friends.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“We were warmly welcomed by the missionary circle
and old friends out of it, native and foreign. Wish you
could have seen the congratulatory presents our native
friends and neighbours brought to shew their gladness
at our return.</p>

<p>“The king (being ill at the time) said ‘He was glad
the old missionaries had returned; he had been very
sorry that Maw House and Maw Mattoon were gone.’”</p>
</div>

<p>A few weeks later, when the king was able, he sent
for Dr. House and gave a private audience.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“On presenting myself at the palace gate when my
name was announced the king said (so I was told by
some around him) ‘Dr. H. is not like other foreigners;
let him come to me at once.’ I was ushered into the
royal palace ere he had left the grand audience hall—his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
courtiers and pages waiting upon him. I was received
with the cordiality and familiarity of an old
acquaintance.</p>

<p>“He asked me how I came? Did Mrs. H. come with
me; what countries I had seen? Mentioning Egypt, he
asked me if the canal across the isthmus of Suez would
succeed. Saying I had now gone around the world,
returning to Siam by crossing the Pacific Ocean to
China, he quickly interrupted, ‘Then you lost a day!’
and explained to his attendants how it was....</p>

<p>“It was time for him now to make his evening visit
to the vast and lofty structure they were rearing for the
funeral solemnities of the late second king. Inviting me
to follow, he went down to his sedan and, preceded by
soldiers and followed by a crowd of attendants, was
borne away. Following, I found him seated in a temporary
pavilion erected where he could overlook the
work. He soon called me to his side—I, alone, of the
hundreds around him, stood upright. He made inquiries
concerning Mrs. Caswell, and as he looked again at her
picture, turning to the princess royal acting as his sword
bearer, said, ‘This was the wife of the teacher that I
revered.’ It was gratifying and interesting to see these
pleasant memories of persons and events passed away
eighteen years before, stealing over him.</p>

<p>“Having intimated to the king my wish to take up my
note for one thousand dollars in his treasurer’s hands
and saying that I should, of course, expect to pay interest
on the balance of five hundred dollars—after deducting
five hundred dollars paid to Mrs. C. on his
majesty’s behalf—in a few days his majesty’s private
treasurer paid me a visit, having had the king’s instruction
to receive from me simply five hundred dollars, and
to surrender to me the note on which was endorsed these
words in the king’s own handwriting:</p>

<p>“‘S. P. P. M. Mongkut, the King, does not wish to
have interest from the loan to his good friend Doctor
Samuel R. House—wishing but some useful books, etc.,
according to the pleasure of said doctor, with stating of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
price of article. This testimony given 1st January, 1867,
the seventeenth year of our reign.’”</p>
</div>


<h3>THE AWAKENING OF 1866–7</h3>

<p>Doubtless the greatest joy upon return to Siam was
to find that a great spiritual awakening had taken
place in the mission school. If the fruits of labour
seem sparse so far it must be considered that the most
favourable soil had scarcely time to produce its harvest.
The boys and girls who had been under the
intimate influence of Dr. and Mrs. House in the school
were just approaching the adolescent age when, in
1866, a spiritual awakening manifested itself. News
of this work of grace had reached Dr. House at Hong
Kong, and upon arrival at Bangkok he rejoiced to
learn that the facts more than confirmed the report.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Found all well and the very best of good news awaiting
us, confirming the hopes I have felt all along that a
better day was about to dawn on us in Siam. Two of
our oldest and most promising pupils (Hee, the writer of
that interesting letter to me, published in the <cite>Foreign
Missionary</cite> last year, being one of them), and a native
teacher in our employ (a man of some education) were
baptised a few weeks ago as converts from heathenism;
and another native teacher, Naah (Esther’s husband),
with others of the pupils in the mission school are
desirous of Christian baptism. These new converts
with the older church members sustain semi-weekly
prayer-meetings among themselves with warm interest.”</p>
</div>

<p>The convert named in this letter was Tien Hee,
who, a few years later, went to America to seek a
higher education. Graduating in medicine at the New
York University in 1871, he returned to Siam, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
he became the first native physician practising the
Western system of medicine. He became eminently
successful in his practise, amassed considerable
wealth, received the title of Phra Montri and lately
has been elevated to a higher rank of nobility, as Phya
Sarasin. In grateful recognition of what Christianity
has done for him he has made generous contributions
toward the work of the mission.</p>

<p>Two months later Dr. House reported further
confessions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“It was my privilege and joy last Sabbath to receive
to our little mission church in the ordinance of baptism
three Christian converts, all connected or once connected
with our mission boarding school; and one of these my
dear old pupil Naah (Esther’s husband), the boy especially
given me by his Chinese father on his dying
bed. The others were Dik and Ting.... You do not
know how many fold I felt repaid by the privilege I
enjoyed that Sabbath.”</p>
</div>

<p>In August of that year (1867) he writes further:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“We are permitted to report the admission by baptism
to our native church at this station at our last communion
of five new members. Two of them girls that
have been long under instruction in the missionary families;
two others, elder pupils in the mission school for
boys; and the fifth, one more advanced in years.</p>

<p>“Among the four young persons who kneeled one
after another to receive the solemn ordinance which
made them church members was our dear Ooey, who
has long in her heart been persuaded of the truth of our
religion and the importance of attendance to it, and who
a few weeks before came out bright and clear and decided,
in her determination to serve the Saviour. Again
it fell to my lot to administer the ordinance; and a privilege<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
unspeakable it was to stand up and in the name of
the Lord to apply the seal of the covenant to the dusky
brow of that child of many prayers, and to others I had
helped teach the way to heaven.</p>

<p>“That Sabbath evening Ooey told me with beaming
eyes that her heart was full of happiness. And yet only
the day before the poor child had been told by her
heathen father—who was angry with her for forsaking
the old religion—that she ‘must never call him father,
nor her mother, mother again’....</p>

<p>“The fifth is Ah Keo, for over twenty years a servant
in the different mission families. I recollect talking and
praying with him the first year I was in Siam. But his
besetting sin, intemperance, made all exhortation lost on
him till this spring—a miracle of grace has been
wrought.”</p>
</div>

<p>This religious interest increased with the days, so
that the semi-weekly meeting for prayer gave way to
a daily meeting, in which the young Christians exhorted
their fellow students and friends to believe on
Christ, and their hearts were poured out in intercession
for the conversion of their families and of Siam.
Then, in September, Dr. House records another confession
from among the student group:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Delia made our hearts very glad the other day by
coming to us and saying her mind was made up to become
a Christian, and wished to be baptised. Her
mother and brother would be very angry with her, but
she felt she must take up her cross. She is a girl of a
great deal of decision and energy of character.”</p>
</div>

<p>The fall meeting of the Presbytery of Siam for
1867 was marked by items of unusual interest. Dr.
House was installed pastor of the church, as a successor
to Mr. Mattoon. The formal call for his pastoral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
services (signed by thirteen members), the
charge to the pastor and people, the prayers and the
sermon were all in the Siamese language—an index
of the development of self-government in the native
church. At the same meeting A. Klai, of Petchaburi,
was licensed as a native local preacher, apparently the
first to be fitted for that rank. Dr. House jocularly
refers to him as a “graduate of the McFarland Theological
Seminary of Petchaburi,” as he had been under
the instruction of Mr. McFarland. At the communion
in the Bangkok church this same autumn occurred
the ordination of the first native elder of the local
church, the congregation having elected the young
man Naah already mentioned.</p>


<h3>THE NOTABLE TRIP TO LAO</h3>

<p>One notable trip of Dr. House remains to be narrated,
a journey into the land of the Lao—notable
because of the accident which nearly closed the career
of the doctor. The trip occurred in 1868. The previous
year was signalised in the annals of missions in
Siam by the establishment of a station at Chiengmai
among the Lao people in what is now known as North
Siam. It is curious to note that while Dr. House himself
had been among the first to become interested in
these people as he came into contact with the Lao
boatmen at Bangkok and although he once seriously
contemplated leaving the Mattoons alone at Bangkok
while he should carry the Gospel into the unexplored
northland, yet when the proposition was being discussed
by the mission to open a station there the
doctor enters a record of his judgment that the time
is premature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>However, additions to the corps of workers having
made it possible to establish another station, the mission
decided to send Messrs. McGilvary and Wilson,
who had made an exploratory trip the previous season,
to open work among the Lao tribes. In January
of 1867 the McGilvary family set out in small boats,
making the journey all the way up the Meinam. In the
next December the Wilsons followed along the same
route. It was a three-months’ journey up Siam’s great
river, whose name means “mother of waters.” Above
Raheng the stream forces its way through a narrow
gap in the mountain chain, forming a long series of
perilous rapids and affording scenery which is described
by voyagers as of surpassing beauty.</p>

<p>Dr. House wrote concerning the reason for his
own trip:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“And here I must let you into a little secret. Mrs.
Wilson, it seems, will require the attendance of a physician
about the first of March, and so also will Mrs.
McGilvary. So much the worse for both of them, you
will say—seeing they are five hundred miles from medical
aid. Must they, then, be abandoned to their fate?
You must not, then, dear brother, be much surprised to
learn that this double call of Providence has proved too
strong for me. Much as I dislike the practise of my
profession, much as I dread the long, tedious journey,
much as I desire just now to stay with my interesting
and most dearly loved flock [the church over which the
doctor had just been made pastor] I have felt it would
be wrong for me to decline the invitation I have received
to visit Chiengmai at the critical time.</p>

<p>“But I cannot afford to waste three months on the
journey there, when by boat to Raheng in twenty-three
days Chiengmai from there can be reached by elephant
in eight to ten days more.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>Accordingly, the doctor determined to take the
quicker route, and by February 13, he had reached
Raheng. There he was delayed five days waiting for
elephants to be provided for him. The company then
set out over the mountains, expecting to reach their
destination nearly on schedule time. Then came the
accident, the story of which is most vividly set forth
in the letter written by Dr. House himself on that
same day.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="padr1">“Ban Hong North Laos,</span><br />
“Monday, March 2, 1868.</p>

<p class="left noindent"><span class="smcap">“Rev. Mr. and Mrs. McGilvary.</span></p>

<p class="left noindent"><span class="smcap">“Dear Brother and Sister</span>:</p>

<p>“So near and yet unable to get farther. Is it not a
strange Providence? When I started this morning
strong and well, refreshed by a Sabbath’s day rest at the
little hamlet of Wong Luang I was rejoicing in the
thought that I was almost at the end of this tedious and
almost endless journey through the sultry wilderness
and would soon receive the welcome which such friends
as you will give, when about eight or nine A. M. my elephant
by whose side I was walking, suddenly and without
provocation turned upon me and pushed me over
with his trunk and, when lying on the ground, thrust one
of those huge tusks at me and into my poor body—how
deep I know not, but ripping up my abdomen two and
one-half inches just below the umbillicus. It was a
strange sensation I assure you. I was expecting another
thrust which I could not escape, for I was jammed
in by the side of a tree. By this time, however, his
driver had got his head turned into the road again.</p>

<p>“And there I was in the far woods with very probably
a fatal wound and none but servants and Laos elephant
drivers. As my men came up poor Beo, who is
most faithful and much attached, burst into tears. And
now thoughts of Harriette and home rushed over me.
But God my Saviour, God to whom only yesterday I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
renewed my consecration of myself as His servant in a
sweet retired spot on the beautiful mountain stream
where we were camped, has permitted—nay ordered—this
unlooked-for calamity; and in God I trust, blessed
be His Name for sustaining me through the hours of
this sad day.</p>

<p>“Such wound, of course, must be sewed up, and at
once, and I must do it, for I could trust none of those
with me, new men all but good Beo. It was curious
business, this sewing up one’s own abdomen; but it must
be done, and it was done—four stitches. By this time
my men had contrived a very comfortable litter with an
awning from the bamboos growing near at hand. Of
course climbing upon an elephant and enduring the
merciless rocking motion was out of the question. So
borne by four men on the litter we slowly journeyed on
through the dry, parched woods, over mountains and
across the dry water brooks from eleven or twelve to
five P. M., when we reached this village on the Maa Li
River, on the route from Muang Tern and Muang Li to
Lampoon. And I am writing this by candlelight in the
Sala Klang of the place lying on my back. It is wearisome
work to write and I must stop soon. The people
here seem kind. I have engaged a messenger to take
this announcement of my misfortune to Chiengmai.</p>

<p>“And now, my dear brother and dear sister (and if
Brother Wilson and his dear wife have arrived, I include
them also), I need not say to you how serious is
the injury I have received. The first thought was that
the omentum or caul had protruded; it may have been
lacerated fat under the skin. It was replaced, of course.
But whether the cavity of the peritoneum was pierced
or not, (and my symptoms would have been more severe
if it had been, I think), still there must have been much
contusion of the bowels, and of course great danger of
peritonitis, the gravest of all diseases. I must lie perfectly
still for days and days to have a chance of getting
well. Another day of such jolting as today would be
fatal. My only hope is in absolute rest. My bowels are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
very sore, of course; but God will not forsake His child
and I will try to bear all that is appointed me. I write
to notify you that you, too, may trust your dear Sophia,
and brother W. his dear Kate, in the same ever gracious
hands. His angel has laid his hands upon me and
stopped me here.</p>

<p>“I write also to say that neither of you must think of
coming over (from Chiengmai it is three days on elephant)
to visit me. You can do me no manner of good
and your wives absolutely require you both at home just
now. It would be positively wrong for you to leave
them. I have good, kind servants, medicines, books, and
best of all my Saviour’s presence, and I am resigned to
His will. But, Oh, poor Harriette—pray for her. We
will pray for each other, and God bless you and yours
till we meet.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr4">“Affectionately,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">S. R. House</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent">“P. S. If I get well, I—or if not, my four men—will
proceed to Chiengmai and deliver to you there six hundred
ticals I am bringing to your mission.”</p>
</div>

<p>This letter records a story of nerve and fortitude
seldom equalled in the annals of travel and exploration.
One must pause after reading it to take in the
whole situation. The note itself was written at the
close of the day of shock and pain and suffering. It
was written while the sufferer was lying flat on his
back, scarcely able to move without agitating the
wound; and written then lest a night’s delay might
find him unable to write. But as you read the letter
you are conscious that he writes not because he is
thinking of his own need, but because he knows that
his friends will be greatly alarmed by his failure to
appear. The trip itself had been undertaken in a
spirit of self-abnegation solely for the welfare of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
fellow missionaries. And the necessity of the trip
casts a vivid light upon the deprivations and hardships
of those pioneer missionaries. There are those who
will exclaim, “Fools! why did they go so far from
contact with civilisation and under such circumstances,—five
hundred miles from the nearest physician!”
Yes, fools! but fools for the sake of the Gospel of
Jesus Christ, “of whom the world was not worthy.”</p>

<p>Further details of this marvellous adventure are
given in a letter written two weeks later from the
same place, the original of which is still preserved.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I wonder if any surgeon was ever before called
upon to sew up his own abdomen! Somehow nerve was
given me to put in the four stitches without shrinking,
though it was a work of no little difficulty, as I had to
be guided by the reflection in a looking-glass—the wound
not being in direct line of vision—as I lay on my back
too weak to sit up. All the water I had was in a small
porous drinking vessel—not over a pint, and no other
supply for miles....</p>

<p>“That evening I arranged for a messenger to carry
the tidings of my injury to the mission at Chiengmai.
On the evening of the third day they returned, and with
them a servant of Mr. McGilvary came along, and also
our faithful Christian Siamese brother, Nai Chune, who
had gone up in charge of Mr. Wilson’s household goods
to Chiengmai.... Had my letter reached Chiengmai a
few hours later it would have found Nai Chune gone,
for his passage was taken and his things aboard the
boat to start that day for Bangkok....</p>

<p>“I am lost in wonder when I think of the Providence
by which I escaped seemingly inevitable death. Who
ever heard of one being impaled on an elephant’s tusk
and yet living to tell the tale. God’s merciful Providence
ordered that when I was unexpectedly felled to
the ground I was thrown—not flat on my back, in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
case I had been pierced through and through; but on my
right side, hence his tusk which was aimed at the middle
line of my body glanced and so did not enter deep
enough to inflict a mortal wound. Had it pierced but
the thickness of this paper deeper than it did, peritoneal
inflammation would have ensued and speedy death....</p>

<p>(Later.) “The afternoon of the day I wrote the
foregoing letter a loaded elephant came to the sala
where I am lying, and the one riding it began to hand
down various baskets and bundles as if they had reached
their destination. It proved to have been sent by my
good brethren of Chiengmai, who had forwarded supplies
of everything that could be thought of to make a
sick man comfortable....</p>

<p>“With wise forethought they had arranged that a boat
should be awaiting me at the nearest landing place on
the river to take me to Chiengmai. I was too weak then
and the wound was not in a state to allow of my leaving
the sala; but the next Monday (just two weeks from the
date of the injury) I ventured to try the litter again.
So with a new set of elephants for my luggage and
bearers for myself hired in the village, that afternoon
at 3 o’clock we started, but found no camping place till
11 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>—a weary journey! But all forgotten next
morning when my eyes rested again on the Meinam
River and I was transferred to the boat. Two days of
vigourous poling up the river brought me to my friends’
landing about five <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> Wednesday, March 18.”</p>
</div>

<p>By Nai Chune the doctor was able to send to his
wife the news of the misfortune, though it was two
months after the accident before she received the message.
Trusty servants were then sent up to meet him
at Raheng, where his boats were awaiting his return.
The complete healing of the wound and recuperation
of strength required more time than he had anticipated
so that he was compelled to remain at Chiengmai<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
six weeks. During this enforced delay he had the
privilege of assisting in organising the first church at
Chiengmai, a little gratification to his old and ardent
desire for the evangelisation of the Lao. The return
was made all the way by water. From Chiengmai to
Raheng the voyage required eighteen days, and thence
his own boats carried him the remainder of the way
to Bangkok in twelve days.</p>

<p>It is probable that Dr. House accomplished more
touring in Siam than any other missionary. During
the first ten years, within which most of the exploring
was done, he was more free than Mr. Mattoon to be
absent for long periods and distant journeys. While
the other missions were restricting their work Dr.
House had visions of enlarging the range of Presbyterian
activities. All the fields of present mission stations
in central Siam had been explored by Dr. House
and seed sown long before permanent work was undertaken.
Love of pioneering and zeal for the Gospel
united to impel him to search out the land with a
view to ultimate conquest for Christ.</p>

NEW KING, NEW CUSTOMS, NEW
FAVOURS</h2>

<p class="drop-capy">It is a noteworthy testimony to the influence of
the American missionaries that through their instruction
in modern science the most enlightened
monarch of the Orient should have come to his death
as a result of his zeal in behalf of astronomy. Although
since he had ascended the throne King Mongkut
had not been able to devote time to pursuit of the
sciences as he had done while a priest in the watt, yet
he maintained a real interest. His requests to Dr.
House for translations from foreign journals included
items of scientific interest. His patronage of the mission
school in favour of the sons of nobles was not
merely to have them taught English, but that through
that language they might obtain instruction in the
sciences.</p>

<p>When circumstances brought it within his power to
lend assistance to the scientific world he seized the
opportunity with a royal will. Astronomers had predicted
a total eclipse of the sun for the year 1868, and
indicated that the southern peninsula of Siam would
be the sole place on the globe where the eclipse would
appear in totality. In his great enthusiasm, desiring
to be a patron of science, the king determined to lead
an expedition to witness the phenomena. Dr. House
describes the preparations in a letter (Aug., 1868):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The gulf of Siam lay in the greatest duration of the
solar eclipse since the sun began to shine, as some say;
attracting to these realms astronomers from Western
Europe. Great preparations were made to receive them
with all honor and to join them in witnessing the solar
phenomena, on the part of our science-loving king and
his government. Large levies of men were made to put
up at the spot fixed by the French astronomical expedition
suitable buildings for all who were present. No
expense was spared in the way of entertaining the numerous
guests. It is said that two thousand catties of
silver ($96,000.) were expended upon the affair by our
public spirited king. A free ticket on a beautiful ship
of war, and entertainment while there, to all us foreign
residents. But as Mr. McDonald (now acting consul)
desires to go and both could not well be absent so long
from the station, I did not go down; and then, too, we
were sure of a very respectable eclipse here in Bangkok,
which I wished to improve for the benefit of the pupils
in our school and our native friends.... Here we saw
stars distinctly in the day time during the greatest
obscuration.”</p>
</div>

<p>The site chosen by the astronomers was in the
jungle, in which the king caused a clearing to be made
and temporary huts to be constructed. During the
brief sojourn in this unhealthy spot, the king contracted
a fever. The disease proved fatal, death occurring
shortly after the king returned to the royal palace.</p>

<p>The death of the king was a sore loss to the world.
Dr. House wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The missionaries lost, some of them a kind personal
friend and a ‘well-wisher’ as he used to sign himself,
and all a friendly-disposed liberal-minded sovereign, who
put no obstacle in the way of their evangelising his
people.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Western nations lost a royal friend who had opened
the gates of his kingdom for intercourse. But Siam
herself, while mourning the death of an enlightened
sovereign, had gained so much through the seventeen
years of his felicitous reign that his death could not
stop her progress in the paths he had opened for her.
The light which had found its way into the jungle of
human notions through the clearing Mongkut had
made was never again to pass into eclipse.</p>


<h3>KING CHULALONGKORN</h3>

<p>With the death of King Mongkut the personal relations
of the pioneer missionaries with the reigning
monarch were terminated. Concerning the successor,
Chulalongkorn, Dr. House wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I have not seen much of the young prince in childhood;
he had been under the tutorship of the English
governess Mrs. Leonowens and, later, of Mr. Chandler
(formerly a lay Baptist missionary).... He had
grown to maturity during the nearly three years of my
absence in America.”</p>
</div>

<p>As second or vice-king there had been chosen
Prince George Washington, with whom Dr. House
was better acquainted.</p>

<p>The missionaries were eager to learn whether the
new government was to be as progressive as the old,
and especially to know the attitude to be assumed
towards their work. Signs that progression was to
be the order of the reign were not long wanting.
Custom hitherto required that the coronation should
be in the presence of the princes only. At the coronation
of Chulalongkorn an innovation was introduced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
by invitations to the official representatives of
other nations resident in Bangkok to attend. Shortly
after the coronation the missionaries arranged,
through the United States consul, to pay their respects
to the new king. They were graciously received,
and although the young king was suffering
from effects of a fever contracted on the ill-fated
astronomical expedition, he gave them an audience
and conversed with them a few minutes. When the
consul was arranging for his official visit of congratulations
upon the vice-king, that personage requested as
a personal favour that the consul be accompanied by
Dr. House. The king was but fifteen years of age
when he came to the throne, and during his minority
the government was under the regency of <span lang="bn" xml:lang="bn">Somdetch
Chao Phya Boromaha Sri Suriwongse</span>, an able and
upright statesman.</p>

<p>With rapid succession came decrees changing age-long
customs and bringing Siamese social and civil
institutions into line with Western civilisation. The
most radical and noteworthy of these changes were:
the abolition of the practice of prostration by which
everyone, of whatsoever rank, had been obliged to
prostrate himself on the ground, face downwards, in
the presence of any who had a superior rank in the
social scale; the introduction at court and in the army
of a modified European dress to cover the near-nudity
which formerly prevailed; the prohibition of
enslavement for debt, a pernicious custom by which
parents could sell their children, husbands their wives,
and anyone himself into servitude to discharge a ruinous
debt, resulting in a state of peonage from which
the hopeless victim could scarce escape; reformation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
of unjust political practises; and the initiation of a
state system of schools, telegraphs and posts.</p>

<p>Concerning two of these reforms interesting sidelights
have been cast by writers. Mrs. Leonowens,
by whom the prince had been tutored in English, relates
that when he heard of the death of Abraham
Lincoln he declared that “if he ever lived to reign
over Siam he would reign over a free and not an
enslaved nation, and that he would restore the ancient
constitutional government and make Siam a kingdom
of the free.” Mr. J. G. D. Campbell, in his volume
<cite>Siam in the Twentieth Century</cite>, sketches the court-scene
when the ancient custom of prostration was
abolished:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“In 1874,” he writes, “King Chulalongkorn assembled
his ministers and nobles and, having ascended the throne,
promulgated a decree emancipating them and all subjects
from the degrading custom of crawling on their
knees in the presence of a superior; after which, at his
command the whole assembly arose from their prostrate
position on their hands and knees and stood erect for
the first time in the presence of their sovereign.”</p>
</div>

<p>Though his personal relation with the occupant of
the throne was terminated, Dr. House found that the
new government included many of his old-time
friends from the days of his lectures on science.
Among these were the regent himself, the minister of
foreign affairs, the master of the new mint and the
commander-in-chief of the army. A new office also
had been established, and the doctor found his friend
Godata, formerly a priest in Chao Fah Yai’s watt,
appointed as court preacher with the duty of preaching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
on the Christian Sabbath a moral lecture to the
soldiers and cadets, by the king’s orders.</p>


<h3>NEW FAVOURS</h3>

<p>The mission workers hoped that a change in sovereigns
would mean no reaction; they scarcely expected
more. But while King Mongkut had “put no
obstacle in the way,” King Chulalongkorn soon removed
the remaining obstacles by making effective
the treaty provisions even in the dependency of Lao.
For it was the rapid development of the work in that
new station that precipitated a condition in which the
good offices of the new government alone saved the
day. Within two years of the beginning of work at
Chiengmai the first convert made a confession of
faith, Nan Inta; and in seven months more six others
had received baptism. Then suddenly the virulence
of the king of Lao was manifested by the martyrdom
of two of these converts, put to death on his orders.</p>

<p>As the Lao state was subject to the king of Siam,
and as the government had given permission for the
missionaries to work in that dependency, appeal was
taken promptly to the regent for protection of the
Lao missionaries whose lives were in danger. The
regent sent a commissioner with all dispatch to
Chiengmai with stringent orders to the Lao ruler that
the missionaries must receive the full protection guaranteed
by the treaty between Siam and the United
States. Enraged by this invocation of a higher
authority, the Lao king declared that while the missionaries
might remain as the Siamese government
had ordered, yet they must not teach religion or make
Christians; and openly vowed his purpose to kill any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
of his people who should become converts to the new
religion. The situation had apparently become impossible;
and to gain time while deciding what course
was best under the circumstances, the work was suspended,
and the workers had virtually decided to leave
in the spring. About that time, however, the tyrant
with a large suite left for Bangkok to attend the cremation
ceremonies of his late suzerain. While there
he fell sick, and before he could reach his Chiengmai
capital he died. Upon his death the supreme power
within the province passed to the hands of one kindly
disposed to the missionaries.</p>

<p>In the same year as the death of the Lao king,
1870, a royal proclamation was issued which appeared
in part in the Bangkok Calendar for the next year.
This proclamation was a decree of religious liberty.
Apparently, although not of a certainty, it had some
connection with the recent affair among the Lao. A
paragraph from this proclamation shows the broadmindedness
of the government at that period:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“In regard to the concern of seeking and holding a
religion that shall be a refuge to yourself in this life, it
is a good concern and exceedingly appropriate and suitable
that you all—every individual of you—should investigate
and judge for himself according to his own
wisdom. And when you see any religion whatever, or
any company of religionists whatever, likely to be of advantage
to yourself, a refuge in accord with your own
wisdom, hold to that religion with all your heart. Hold it
not with a shallow mind, with mere guess work or merely
because of its general popularity or from mere traditional
saying that it is the custom held from time immemorial.
And do not hold a religion that you have not
good evidence is true and then frighten men’s fears and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
flatter their hopes thereby. Do not be frightened and
astonished at diverse fictitious events and hold to and
follow them. When you shall have obtained a refuge, a
religious faith that is good and beautiful and suitable,
hold to it with great joy and follow its teachings, and it
will be a cause of prosperity to each one of you....
It is our will that our subjects of whatever race, nation
or creed live freely and happily in the kingdom, no man
despising or molesting another on account of religious
difference, or any other difference of opinion, custom
or manners.”</p>
</div>

<p>Oddly enough, Dr. House, who seemed always to
make mention of the innovations of the progressive
government under the new king, makes no reference
to this proclamation in his letters, nor does he mention
it in his chapter on the history of missions in
<em>Siam and Laos</em>. In this last named work, however,
he states that on Sept. 29, 1878, the king of Siam issued
“a proclamation establishing religious toleration
in Laos and by implication throughout all his
dominions.”</p>

<p>Early in 1871 an incident occurred which was
fraught with great consequence for native Christians,
and one in which Dr. House’s friendly intimacy with
the high officials enabled him to render a service of
far-reaching consequence to the young native church.
One of the girls of the school, Ooey, shortly after she
had made a confession of faith, was called as a witness
in court upon a suit in behalf of another member
of the church. It was then the custom to allow the
Chinese to take oath according to their religion; but
there was no provision in the law for the Christian
oath. When this young girl was asked to take the
native oath, she told the court boldly that she was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
Christian and that she could not take an oath based
on the native religion; and she demanded to be sworn
upon her Christian faith. The court tried to induce
her to accede to custom, assuring her that it was but
a harmless formula. But she steadily refused, although
she was an important witness, the lack of
whose testimony was greatly to the disadvantage of a
fellow-Christian. In consequence the case was suspended,
in hopes that she would change her attitude.</p>

<p>The matter was at once brought to the attention of
Dr. House, who recognised that the situation involved
elements which were of serious consequence to the
religious rights of native Christians. If compelled to
take oath, it would infringe upon their conscience.
If not permitted to substitute the Christian oath, they
would have to forfeit their standing in the court in
all cases. The doctor at once sought an interview
with the minister of foreign affairs, his old friend and
former Lieutenant-Governor of Petchaburi, and also
with the regent, an old-time friend. After laying
before them the nature of the case, an order was
issued directing that a witness be sworn by the
faith to which he claimed allegiance. This action,
so far as appears, was the first step in the legal
recognition of the Christian faith on the part of the
government.</p>


<h3>PROGRESS</h3>

<p>During the last decade of Dr. House’s services
there were many recruits to the force of workers.
But these additions were not a net gain, for in the
meantime there were numerous withdrawals on account
of health. In 1869 came Revs. J. W. Van<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
Dyke and John Carrington with their wives. Two
years later were added Rev. and Mrs. R. Arthur,
Rev. J. N. Culbertson and Miss E. S. Dickey. Miss
Arabella Anderson came in 1872 to assist in the new
boarding school for girls. The year 1874 saw the
arrival of an unusual number of unmarried women
missionaries. They were Misses S. M. Coffman, M.
L. Cort and E. D. Grimshaw. Then, in 1875, Rev.
and Mrs. Eugene P. Dunlop reached Bangkok and
began a very long period of valuable service.</p>

<p>Increase of workers meant not diminution but
rather increase of work. This is typified in the case
of Dr. House himself, who jocularly wrote to his
brother that “Satan will not likely find mischief for
my hands to do,” and then recounts the duties that
devolve upon him. The varied activities that he mentions
not only show the versatility required of a missionary
but indicate the manifold duties that each
missionary has to perform. He writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I have recently become a theological professor, four
evenings of the week gathering around me in my study
the more advanced and promising of the native church
members ... and try to pilot them through the leading
principles of a system of divinity.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">One of these men, Ooan Si Tieng, was ordained in
1872. He had been the first Chinese convert in the
mission and now became the first to receive this full
authority from the Presbytery. As pastor of the native
church Dr. House had a full measure of sorrows as
well as joys, for there is a tide in spiritual affairs that
has its ebb as well as its flow, and the years of spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
awaking were followed by periods of depression.
Thus at the beginning of 1869 he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Our spiritual prospects at the opening of the year
are not as bright as last new year—one or two sad and
unexpected fallings away from the faith have greatly
tried and pained our hearts.”</p>
</div>

<p>But this reaction was transient, for two years later,
in telling of the week of prayer in January, he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Our native Christians are quite interested, sustaining
the meetings nobly. Indeed I have thrown the meetings
upon them altogether and they take turns in leading
them. You do not know what comfort it is to have in
my little flock enough able and willing to carry on these
meetings.... It would do you good to witness the
spirit of faithfulness on their part to the souls of their
impenitent friends and neighbours.”</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to his duties as pastor of the mission
church, Dr. House was appointed superintendent of
the mission press in 1870, and for that year also was
elected secretary of the mission in charge of the
records and correspondence. At the same time he
was offered a royal appointment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Projects are now on foot in both kings’ palaces for
schools for the instruction of the young nobility of Siam
in English and the sciences. I have been earnestly solicited
by the Second King George to aid in establishing
the one he is planning. Happy would I be to lend a
helping hand if other duties would allow.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">After two years the doctor was relieved of the charge
of the Press and appointed again to the more congenial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
task of supervising the mission school, a
position which he continued to fill until his final withdrawal
from the field.</p>

<p>In the midst of these incidents the actual growth of
the Mission must not be overlooked. It has to be
recorded that in spite of arduous and faithful labours
of the increasing corps of workers and in the face of
all the encouraging marks of advance in Western
civilisation, Siam responded very slowly to the spiritual
appeal of the Gospel. While she gladly recognised
and sought after the material benefits of
Christianity she continued to manifest her characteristic
indifference to its more vital message. Mr.
McDonald, in his book on <cite>Siam, Its Government,
Manners and Customs</cite>, says that when he arrived in
Siam in 1861 there was but one native convert in connection
with the mission, whereas ten years later there
was a church in Bangkok with only twenty members
and another in Petchaburi with a like number. He
then adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“It is just to state that there is scarcely any other
field in which modern missions have been established
where the introduction of the gospel has met with so
little opposition as in Siam proper.... It is equally
just to say that there is scarcely any other field which
has been so barren of results. Pure Buddhism seems to
yield more slowly to the power of the gospel than any
other false system.”</p>
</div>

<p>The reason for this unyielding nature of Buddhism
seems to lie in its ethical theories which are the result
of its philosophy of life. In some measure, too, this
indifference of Buddhism to a spiritual interpretation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
of life accounts for its non-resistance towards the
preaching of an antagonistic religion. The primary
fallacies of Buddhism from the Christian point of
view are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“1. No Creator and no Creating: Things just happened.
This conception leads to indifference to nature
and to a belief that the body is vile, to be despised and
disregarded.</p>

<p>“2. No idea of a Spiritual Personality, whether human
or divine. Emphasis is placed on mind and intellect
to the exclusion of will and feeling. Hence Buddhism
is a philosophy rather than a religion, a theory of existence
rather than a motive force.</p>

<p>“3. No true sense of relationship of man to man or
of man to God, in the absence of spiritual personality.
Everything is ego-centric, each for himself. Hence incomplete
ideas of love, faith, sin, holiness, suffering; in
the absence of hope fear dominates life.</p>

<p>“4. The greatest fundamental error is the assertion
of the Karma law as the sole principle that explains all
(the law of ethical causation, by which the merit or demerit
of every act in this life effects the future life).
This leads to a denial of personality and to fatalism,
formality, trust in the individual’s merit, denial of forgiveness
and self satisfaction.”</p>
</div>

<p>But if the work at that stage had few numerical
results to display, yet a keen discernment would show
that other larger results were being accomplished.
Mr. George B. Bacon, in his volume on Siam, shows a
true appreciation of what missions had accomplished
up to that time:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“At first sight their efforts, if measured by count of
converts, might seem to have resulted in failure....
But really the success of these efforts has been extraordinary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
although the history of them exhibits an order of
results almost without precedent. Ordinarily the religious
enlightenment of a people comes first and the
civilization follows as a thing of course. But here the
Christianisation of the nation has scarcely begun, but
its civilisation has made much more than a beginning.
For it is to the labours of the Christian missionaries in
Siam that the remarkable advancement of the kings and
nobles, and even of the common people in general is
owing....</p>

<p>“When Sir John Bowring came in 1855 to negotiate
his treaty ... he found the fruit was ripe before he
plucked it. And it was by the patient and persistent labours
of the missionaries for twenty years that the results
which he achieved were made not only possible
but easy.”</p>
</div>

<p>But there is evidence of even more subtle effect of
the gospel. No one who reads of the notable changes
in the social customs and political institutions introduced
by the young King Chulalongkorn can resist the
conclusion that it was the religious support of these
ancient practises that had given way under the disintegrating
light of the Christian Gospel. Even that
earlier attempt of Chao Fah Yai to modernise the
religious teachings among his followers shows that the
religious philosophy of Buddhism could not stand
before the truth of Jesus.</p>


<h3>LITERARY WORK</h3>

<p>In the literary field Dr. House was receptive rather
than creative. He was a lover of books but not of
writing:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“How irksome and difficult the labour of composition
has been to me,” he says, “I’d rather be a ditch digger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
and shovel mud. The getting of a certain amount of
writing done by a given time is out of the question in
my case.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He was appointed the first “librarian” of the Mission
back in the early days when the library consisted
of two shelves of books and some unbound magazines,
besides “some Malay, Tamul, Bengali, Portuguese
and Indo-Portuguese books for a long time handed
down in the mission.” His reluctance at the pen
partly accounts for the sparsity of matter published
under his name in the missionary magazines. But the
refusal on his part to appear in print in this fashion
was due perhaps more to his fear that journals or
newspapers containing articles on missions would find
their way into the hands of the Siamese government,
which might be displeased with any frank narrative
of observations. For this reason he frequently admonished
the recipients of his letters that they should
not take advantage of his absence to publish his
comments.</p>

<p>When it came to the needs of the mission, however,
he lent his hand and brain to supply the requirements.
The following tracts are ascribed to him:</p>

<p><cite>Scripture Facts</cite>, 1848.</p>

<p><cite>Watt’s Catechism</cite>, bound with The Speller, 1853.</p>

<p><cite>Child’s Catechism with Commandments and Lord’s
Prayer</cite>, 1854.</p>

<p><cite>Questions in Gospel History</cite>, 1864.</p>

<p><cite>Stand by the Truth</cite>, 1869.</p>

<p>These last two in conjunction with Mrs. House.</p>

<p>After return to America he wrote a pamphlet, <cite>Notes
on Obstetric Practises in Siam</cite>, (Putnam, 1897). In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
the volume, <cite>Siam and Laos</cite> (Presbyterian Board,
1884), several chapters were contributed by Dr.
House, including the very comprehensive and accurate
chapter on <cite>History of Missions in Siam</cite>; but so impersonally
did he write the record that it would be
almost impossible for the reader to detect that a good
part of the story had been created in action as well as
recounted by the writer.</p>

<p>The school for boys which Dr. House fostered
almost continuously from its beginning was merged
into the Boys’ Christian High School in 1889. This
institution in turn developed in scope until it was
enlarged into the “Bangkok Christian College,” which
was organised in 1915.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XI">XI<br />
HARRIET PETTIT HOUSE</h2>

<p class="drop-capy">In former years a missionary’s wife was not under
commission of the Board. Her status was similar
to that of the pastor’s wife at home. It is
not infrequent that the work of the wife is just as
vital to the development of the church as that of her
husband, but she receives no recognition in the official
records of the church. Her honour is emblazoned
where the eye cannot see it—in the hearts
of the people. The wife of the pioneer missionary
went out, not at the call of the Church, but at the call
of the husband, with no promise of remuneration
aside from the fabulous bridal endowment which the
groom made at marriage “with all his worldly goods”
and with no official rank to assure the preservation of
her name on the roll of honour.</p>

<p>So it happens that the scanty reports from the
early Siam mission seldom mentioned the name
of Mrs. House. Yet one cannot read the letters
of her husband without perceiving that she supplemented
his educational work in a manner and
to a degree that is worthy of special recognition.
But apart from that, she succeeded finally in so
organising and establishing female education in
Siam that she has come to be regarded as the
founder of permanent educational work for women
in that country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>


<h3>HER FAMILY AND EDUCATION</h3>

<p class="pbot15">Harriet Pettit House was born in Waterford, New
York, Dec. 23, 1820. Her ancestry was Scotch and
English. On the mother’s side the line goes back to
William Mitchell and his wife, Agnes Buchanan, who
emigrated from Glasgow to New England in 1755.
The male line in America began with the Englishman
Abraham Waterhouse, who came to New England,
1729, and “who sleeps with the pilgrim settlers at
Saybrook, Conn.” Her paternal grandfather, John
Pettit, one of the original settlers of Waterford and
a member of the first board of village trustees, came
from Chester, Conn., whence a few years later he
brought his bride, Rebecca Waterhouse.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center pbot15">HARRIET PETTIT HOUSE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Their son, John, is said to have been the first child
born in the new settlement. He became a cabinet
maker. Following his father’s example, he sought a
wife in Chester and married Sarah Parmelee Mitchell,
who was his “second cousin, once removed.” Of this
ancestry and marriage was born the future woman
missionary. The family comprised Mary Jane (dying
in infancy), Eliza Ann, Mary Jane, Harriet Maria,
John Mitchell, William Frederic and Sarah Frances,
all of whom were born at Waterford except the last.
The mother was a member of the Waterford Presbyterian
Church, and the two older daughters united at
an early age. In 1832 the family moved to Sandy
Hill, New York, where resided an uncle, General
Micajah Pettit. While living there Harriet made a
profession of her faith at the age of seventeen. During
residence in that village she became acquainted
with Stephen Mattoon and the young woman who
later became his wife, with both of whom she was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
destined to be associated in Siam. The first appearance
of her name in the journal of Dr. House is a
casual entry that Mrs. Mattoon had received (1851)
a letter from her friend Harriet Pettit. After nine
years the family returned to Waterford in 1841.</p>

<p>Harriet’s elementary education was the best afforded
by the private school system of the period. In
1840 she entered the Emma Willard Female Seminary
at Troy, New York. There she studied for a year,
and then entered upon what proved to be her life
work of female education. Her first year of teaching
was in a young ladies’ school in New York City. For
two years she served as governess for a family in
Charleston, South Carolina. It was while there that
she wrote to her youngest sister a most remarkable
letter of religious importunity. In the winter of 1843
a great revival had aroused the little church at Waterford
under the pastor, Rev. Reuben Smith, in which
sixty-nine were converted. Among these were her
father and two brothers, all of whom united with the
church. Having received news of this awakening,
Harriet sent to her sister, the only member of the
family not yet in the Church, a letter carefully printed
so as to be legible to the girl of ten years. It was a
letter with a purpose. It was an affectionate entreaty
for the sister to become a Christian. Concisely but
clearly she explained what it meant to be a Christian,
and then gently and with fervour urged a prompt
decision for Christ. That letter was not void of its
purpose, and all these eighty years since it has been
treasured by the recipient as a memento of a loving,
consecrated sister.</p>

<p>The Pettit family did not remain long in Waterford<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
after their return. In 1844 they moved to Newark,
New Jersey, and there became identified with the
Second Presbyterian Church, of which at the time the
pastor was a relative, the Rev. Ebenezer Cheever,
who had formerly been their pastor also at Waterford.
Thereupon, Harriet came to Newark and set
up a small school for girls in her home. In 1848 she
was called to be assistant in the female seminary at
Steubenville, Ohio. In the fall of 1851 she returned
to Newark and opened, under her own management, a
“Select School for Young Ladies,” which she continued
up to the time of her marriage. During these later
years she was active in the work of the Second Church,
serving as joint superintendent of the Sunday school.
On Oct. 24, 1855, her father died, leaving Harriet
alone with their mother and her youngest sister.</p>


<h3>MARRIAGE</h3>

<p>It was at this juncture of the family affairs, two
days after the father’s death, that Harriet received an
unexpected call from her friend of former years, Dr.
S. R. House, then home on a furlough from Siam.
Writing later to a friend she comments:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“It is but two years this morning since my good husband
called at 373 Broad Street, Newark, to see a lady
on very particular business. Only two years,—and fifteen
months of that time I have been in the city of
Bangkok. Does not this speak well for Samuel’s despatch
of business sometimes? (Then quoting a bit of
doggerel which he had once written:)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘I haven’t the slightest notion</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of launching on the stormy ocean</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where family cares and troubles rise</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heaping their billows to the skies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A wife’s complaint, the young one’s cries</div>
    <div class="verse indent5">Wont suit me.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“How entirely we sometimes change our minds! On
the morning of the 26th, the ‘batch’ who once thus sung
had not the slightest, but the strongest notion—and
launching forth soon followed.”</p>
</div>

<p>Having changed his mind the suitor allowed little
time to slip by till he had won the object of his heart’s
desire. A month and a day after the engagement, on
Nov. 27, 1855, the marriage occurred.</p>

<p>The bridal couple sailed for Siam in the spring of
1856, arriving at Bangkok in July. On the part of
the natives connected with the mission the bride
was received with a quiet curiosity, for these
people were slow to receive newcomers into their
affections. But King Mongkut, having first given a
private audience to Dr. House, requested particularly
that the bride might come to the palace to receive his
congratulations. Mrs. House describes the call:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“A few weeks afterwards a note came from him inviting
the ladies who, as he expressed it, ‘had not yet
been to pay their personal interview to H. M.,’ and saying
he would send a boat for us. About 2 p. m., the boat
came with one of the ladies of the king’s household and
a train of servants; and Mrs. Morse and I went....
Passing through a gate in the wall of the palace we were
conducted through paved streets on each side of which
are the brick dwellings of the various inmates. As we
passed along we attracted the attention of the residents
who crowded about the doors, curious to see the foreign
ladies.</p>

<p>“At length we arrived at a large building on the
portico of which were chairs, and here we were invited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
to sit to await summons into the royal presence....
After an hour or more a message came from H. M.
announcing his readiness to receive us. We entered a
door guarded by several female soldiers; and here stood
the king to meet us; dressed in a mouse colored, figured
silk sacque, over a white garment—a large diamond
on his breast, a number of very brilliant rings and a gold
watch, and sandals on feet. He extended his right hand
very graciously to us and led the way to a spacious hall,
hung round with mirrors, where we were seated.</p>

<p>“He sent for his favorite wife whom he introduced
as his queen consort, and afterwards sent for her two
children; the eldest a boy of about four years, was
loaded with chains of gold; the youngest a daughter.
Both very handsome. His Majesty was exceedingly
affable, speaking English so that with strict attention we
could understand. He conversed on various subjects
intelligently. Refreshments were served, during which
H. M. left us. When he returned he presented to us
each, as a memento of our visit, a very heavy gold ring
of Siamese manufacture, set with five sapphires. After
being shown through some of the apartments, at sundown
we took our leave.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A belated sequence of this royal welcome was an
invitation to Mrs. House and Mrs. Jonathan Wilson
(newly arrived) to dine with the queen and some of
her ladies in the palace the following year.</p>


<h3>AN INDUSTRIOUS WOMAN</h3>

<p>We catch glimpses of the indefatigable industry of
this woman slightly from her few letters but chiefly
from those of Dr. House. Within a month after
landing, before the house was fairly settled, she began
where the first opportunity presented:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“My good wife has already begun her true missionary
work, for she has a Bible class of nine of our young
folks, whom she instructs Sabbath mornings through the
English tongue which they have partially acquired.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Promptly she took up the important task of learning
the language:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I love the Siamese language very much indeed. The
first month I was here I took no lesson and I have lost
two months since by sickness and absence, but I have
read and nearly translated the gospel of Matthew; and
I begin to make myself understood.”</p>
</div>

<p>During the dry season for the first several years
Mrs. House made tours with her husband. One of
these was to Prabat, the scene of the “footstep of
Buddha,” where the doctor had experienced rough
treatment on his previous visit; on this occasion,
however, no attention was paid to the presence of
foreigners. Mrs. House took pains to write vivid
accounts of many of these tours for the home Sunday
school; these and parts of her letters found their way
into the missionary magazines of the day and afterwards
were incorporated as a part of the volume,
<cite>Siam and Laos</cite>.</p>

<p>In the summer of the second year we find her
teaching an hour-and-a-half daily in the mission
school and giving two hours daily to the study of the
language beside the domestic cares. She had already
taken under her maternal oversight the native girl
Delia, and also accepted charge of Nancy, whom Mrs.
Mattoon had raised; and while in some ways these
wards were an assistance, yet their care and direction
was a great responsibility. Comments upon her zeal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
appear frequently in the doctor’s letters, and ten
years after her arrival he continues to mention her
diligence:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Harriette is as industriously engaged as ever. She
will teach three full hours a day, besides what she does
for her girls at home, reading and translating with the
Siamese teacher. Nor can she be persuaded to spare
herself. Has just started under superintendance of
Delia and Ooey, alternately, an infant sewing and
singing class.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thus by assistance of the girls whom she had already
taught she undertook to extend her reach, training
these girls in teaching under her own direction.
After she had fairly mastered the language she sought
further to enlarge her influence by preparing tracts
and translating pamphlets. She is credited with these
productions:</p>

<p><cite>Questions in Gospel History</cite>, 1864; <cite>Stand by the
Truth</cite>, 1869 (these two in conjunction with Dr.
House); <cite>Catechism in Bible Truth</cite>, 1870; several
juvenile story books.</p>

<p>Concerning the <em>Catechism</em>, Dr. House wrote to
Mrs. House while she was in America (1871): “I
take great satisfaction in the circulation of that little
tract <cite>Bible Truth</cite> you toiled on so faithfully, and I
like it better each day. Our whole school recite their
‘verse a day’ from that now.”</p>


<h3>PRECARIOUS HEALTH</h3>

<p>While admiring her industry. Dr. House expressed
foreboding very early, writing six months after her
arrival: “H. is really very well now, but is far too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
industrious. I am curious to know the effect a Siamese
sun will have on such habits of diligence as she
has brought from the United States.”</p>

<p>That the tropical rays were not to be ignored, even
by consecrated diligence, early became manifested by
a strange “burning sensation in the top of the head,”
from which Mrs. House began to suffer within a year
and which continued, sometimes with alarming discomfort,
throughout her residence in Siam. As the
pain increased rather than abated after seven years
in the tropics, her physician recommended a sojourn
in her native climate in hopes of gaining permanent
relief. Accordingly Dr. and Mrs. House left Bangkok
in February, 1864, and spent two full years in
America. The change brought relief which at the
time it was hoped would be permanent.</p>


<h3>BEGINNINGS OF FEMALE EDUCATION IN SIAM</h3>

<p>It is not possible to ascribe to Mrs. House the beginnings
of education of women in Siam. Even apart
from the efforts of the women of the other missions
to teach the Chinese women, Mrs. Mattoon had at the
outset of her career taken native girls into her home
with a view to educating them. Later she succeeded
in gathering a class of little girls in the Peguan village
across the river from the capital. When Mrs.
House came, in 1856, Mrs. Mattoon was conducting a
class of six or seven married women whom she taught
to read while at the same time giving religious instruction.
Shortly after the coming of Mrs. House,
Mrs. Mattoon seems to have withdrawn from such
work in her favour, as her own time was then largely
occupied with her domestic duties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>Modern female education in Siam may be said to
have begun when the newly crowned King Mongkut,
in August, 1851, requested the ladies of the several
missions to come to the palace in turns for the purpose
of instructing some of the royal ladies. This
was five years before Mrs. House reached Siam. The
intention of the king, as he expressed it, was to
qualify the ladies of the palace to converse with him
in English. The effect of this royal patronage of
female education was not only to break the bondage
of custom which held women in perpetual ignorance
but to quicken popular interest in the mission
school.</p>

<p>Though Mrs. House promptly enlisted in assisting
her husband in the school for boys, her greatest sympathy
was with the girls of Siam. From the first she
sought to reach out toward them, making her first
point of contact by a class in English Bible. As she
came to perceive the age-long inheritance of ignorance
that impoverished the successive generations of Siamese
women she was kindled with a desire to share
with them the heritage of Christian women. This
lack of education she pictures:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“When we first went to Siam not one woman or little
girl in ten could read, although all the boys are taught
by the priests in the temples to read and write. One day
a very bright interesting little girl, twelve years old perhaps,
came to our boat to see the strangers. When asked
if she could read, she did not answer yes or no, but with
surprise exclaimed, ‘Why, I am a girl’—as if we ought
to have known better than to ask a girl such a question.”</p>
</div>

<p>The chief obstacle to education was the notion that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
education had no value for them. Woman’s place
was to serve and please man. So long as she could
cook rice, take care of the children and do necessary
work without knowing books, why learn? Perhaps
Mrs. House did not have a vision of making education
an established factor in the customs of Siam; that
possibility was too vast and too remote to conceive
under the circumstances. But she did have a clear
vision that education was indispensable to the amelioration
of womankind.</p>

<p>Her first step was taken in 1858, concerning which
the doctor wrote: “Daily now Harriette has four
female pupils about her, and the first day they were
present, she came to me looking so happy, saying: ‘O,
I have been in my element today—teaching girls
again.’” This step was of importance chiefly as the
beginning of her definite work in female education.
Otherwise it was rather commonplace. These girls
were just the girls whom the missionaries had taken
into their homes primarily to influence for Christ.
All the missionary families have done this and are
doing so today. Mrs. House gathered them into a
class in order that they might have more regular
school training, and as other families came and other
girls were taken into the homes the number in her
class increased. This class was partly industrial, for
besides instruction in reading the Bible and other elementary
subjects, the girls were taught to sew. With
the aid of an American sewing-machine their skill was
utilised to make garments for the boys of the boarding
school; showing their work could be of value.
About this time Mrs. House also succeeded in winning
the confidence of a group of older women whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
she instructed in an informal manner in domestic
economy.</p>

<p>Along with indifference there was a more concrete
obstacle to progress in education of girls—the economic
factor. Time spent in class was time lost from
labour in the house or in the field; and this was a
serious matter. While Mrs. House had demonstrated
the economic value of domestic training for girls by
the saving in expense for the boys’ school through
their sewing, it remained for Mrs. S. G. McFarland,
at Petchaburi, in 1865, to apply this fact in such a
manner as to draw women into her classes. She offered
prospective pupils employment at a wage equal
to that they could earn elsewhere. So long as they
brought in earnings their fathers, or husbands in some
cases, were not particular how they worked; and if
foreigners were foolish enough to pay them to learn,
the returns were a little more certain than in other
markets. One of the conditions of the school was
that each pupil would devote a part of the time to
learning to read. The skill of hands which they acquired
by training enabled them to earn their wage
and still leave a good margin of time for this instruction.
The result was a demonstration that trained
hands could do more and better work, and that trained
minds made those hands more thrifty. Here was the
answer to the economic objection to female education.</p>

<p>When Mrs. House returned from America, in 1866,
she took up her work with women again. Reporting
home, the doctor wrote: “Harriette is greatly engaged
in her labours of teaching etc., going out to the school
room and calling to her at home the women about us
of whom she has a class now morning and afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
learning to read.” This is only a glimpse, but it
shows that she returns with her purpose steady in
mind. While Dr. House was on his ill-fated trip to
Chiengmai Mrs. House assumed full charge of the
boys’ school and boarding department, and at the
same time continued her classes for women. Perhaps
it should be explained that while the term women is
most commonly used in the doctor’s references to her
work, the word really refers to the young married
women for the most part, girls whom we would class
as of the high school ages or just above.</p>

<p>At length Mrs. House introduced the plan which
Mrs. McFarland had tested at Petchaburi, paying
women for their work which in turn was disposed of
to advantage, but on condition that part of their time
should be devoted to general instruction in the rudiments
of learning, always including the Bible. With
this advance her work for women passed from the
stage of voluntary classes to a recognised established
school. Writing in 1868, Dr. House reported home:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Harriette is greatly engaged in her new industrial
school for women. A busy scene on our back verandah
every morning,—eight sewers.... Harriette’s class of
women in her industrial school for women is a success
and promises great good, though it keeps her busy in
season and out of season.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Mrs. House was able to use in this work some of the
older girls who had been under her motherly care for
some years. When, in 1871, she spent a year in
America, her industrial school was continued under
the direction of Maa Kate and Maa Esther, who took
full charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>


<h3>FURLOUGHS FOR HEALTH</h3>

<p>The three years’ absence from Siam proved to have
only a temporary benefit for Mrs. House’s health.
The burning sensation in her head soon set in anew.
She worked under constant pain; at times her head
was swathed in wet cloths to mitigate the pain so that
she could discharge her duties. Work and suffering
together were exhausting, and after another three
years period she was forced to seek a respite. To this
end, in 1869, she gladly accepted the invitation of the
Burrows, of Canton, that family of good friends to
missionaries, who offered a free passage in one of
their ships and kind hospitality in their home.</p>

<p>This voyage to China proved to be perilous and
alarming reports of a foundered ship reached Dr.
House at Bangkok. Fortunately the ship’s encounter
was not fatal.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“When twenty-eight days out the ship sprang a leak,
made eleven inches of water an hour, eight feet a day.
Men kept constantly at pumps; had to lighten the ship
by throwing over some one thousand sacks of rice, one-tenth
the cargo, and undergird the ship with a large
sail—‘thrumming’ they call it. Spoke a ship which
promised to keep company and to come and help if at
night a certain lantern signal was hoisted. Lost sight
of her however. Were indeed in great peril. But a
gracious Providence brought them in safety.”</p>
</div>

<p>A visit of three months away from the tropics gave
renewed vigour and again Mrs. House returned to
Bangkok with buoyant hopes of a measure of comfort
for her work. But as soon as the dry season had
passed the pain renewed its malign attack. At this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
perspective of time the wonder is that she persisted in
hope of being able even to remain, much less labour
in the tropics. Her persistence is a silent testimony
to her earnest desire to do something for the Siamese
women. After another twelve-month she was again
compelled to seek relief. Desiring to see once more
her mother, then eighty years of age, she sailed alone
for America, arriving in the summer of 1871.</p>


<h3>APPEAL TO THE WOMEN OF AMERICA</h3>

<p>Return to the temperate climate promptly brought
relief and restored her health. Her demonstrated
success in the industrial school had enlarged her hopes
and clarified her vision of the possibilities of female
education; while the rapid modernisation of Siam
under the young King Chulalongkorn quickened her
sense of necessity to place that education upon a
broader and more permanent foundation. Both success
and the opportunity impelled her to lay the
burden of responsibility upon the women of the
Presbyterian Church in America. This year in
America we find her accepting invitations to speak in
Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Albany, Troy and
other places, telling her story and pleading for the
womanhood of Siam.</p>

<p>Just here it is both interesting and amusing to look
back to the attitude of mind towards women speaking
in the Church. The doctor writes to his brother
counseling concerning his wife’s deportment in this
matter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Keep her if possible out of the pulpit—where I
understand the zeal of some returned missionary ladies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
carries them in these days of women’s movement in
mission work.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This would almost be interpreted as a bit of jocular
admonition to a brother’s responsibility, were it not
that we find these cautions direct to the wife:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Don’t step out of your sphere into the pulpit. If you
unsex yourself, I am not sure you will be welcome back
as warmly.... O don’t let anything tempt you to go
beyond your proper sphere as a woman; you cannot
count <ins class="corr" id="tn-210" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: upon a blesssing">upon a blessing</ins> there and you will certainly
grieve many that you love.”</p>
</div>

<p>Nor is the doctor quite as sanguine as his wife over
this project for a general advance in work for women
even in Siam where he knows the situation intimately:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I sympathise with you heartily in your wish to accomplish
much for Siam before our stay here ... is
over. And it may be that the privilege will be given you
of working more for the women of the land. But there
are great difficulties in the way of this and there will be
great trials and disappointments awaiting you. I fear
your distance from Siam lends ‘enchantment to the
view,’ and makes you forget what the people are—heathen
in heart and custom of life. You ought to know
that not a few here are opposed to the principle of
female industrial schools.... It is a very serious question
you propose with reference to bringing a young lady
out with you to reside in your family.”</p>
</div>


<h3>THE “TROY BRANCH” INSTITUTES THE PROJECT</h3>

<p>Mrs. House’s plea for the women of Siam found a
response very near home. It so happened that in the
spring of 1872 Secretaries Irving and Ellinwood, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
the Foreign Board, addressed a meeting of the Synod
of Albany, held at Troy, New York. The Woman’s
Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions of the Synod
of Albany met at the same place, and united with the
Synod to hear the addresses. The result was the
organisation of a branch of the Women’s Board to
cover the Troy Presbytery, whence the name “Troy
Branch.” The organising group not only undertook
to establish auxiliaries in their respective churches
but resolved as a Branch to assume as their first and
special object a boarding school for girls in Bangkok;
and to inaugurate this project they commissioned Mrs.
House, who was known personally to many of the
women of the new organisation. To begin the work
the Branch agreed to provide three thousand dollars;
and for the next four years they raised some one thousand
four hundred and forty dollars. So it happened
that Mrs. House became the official head of the projected
boarding school for girls.</p>

<p>The enterprise which was now committed to her
was much larger in scope than the work she already
had under way; and even with small beginnings there
was need of an assistant to share the burden, lighten
the responsibility and aid in council. While Mrs.
House was in correspondence with several young
women whose interests had been turned towards Siam
by her addresses a young woman of her own church
at Waterford, Arabella Anderson, offered herself.</p>


<h3>ARABELLA ANDERSON-NOYES</h3>

<p>Arabella Anderson was the daughter of James
McL. and Arabella Moreland Anderson, who emigrated
from Belfast about 1847. They settled at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
Waterford, New York, and promptly identified themselves
with the Presbyterian Church. They brought
an infant son with them; another son and three
daughters were born to them in their new home.
Arabella was the eldest daughter, having been born
Nov. 26, 1848. After elementary instruction in the
local school she spent a year in a nearby academy.
At the age of twelve she united with the Church.
Her desire to become a foreign missionary was largely
the fruit of home influence. Both parents were devoted
to the cause of missions. Her father never
forgot to intercede for the work at family prayers.
Her mother had been quickened in zeal for the work
in youth by hearing a missionary to Russia; and it
was her hope that her first born son might become a
missionary, though circumstances prevented this.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1872 Mrs. S. R. House was at
her old home in Waterford planning to return to Siam
for the new enterprise which had been entrusted to
her by the “Troy Branch.” The pastor of the local
church, Rev. R. P. H. Vail, preached a missionary
sermon making a strong appeal for a volunteer to
accompany Mrs. House as a missionary-teacher. This
came to the heart of Miss Anderson as the Master’s
call for enlistment in the work she had long contemplated.
After counsel with her mother she offered
her services to Mrs. House and was accepted. Two
months later, in September, the two sailed for Siam,
reaching Bangkok late in the autumn. It was two
years before the new boarding school for girls could
be housed. In the meantime Miss Anderson took
charge of the younger children in the day school of
the mission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>After the girls’ school was under way, <ins class="corr" id="tn-213" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: by a happy inpiration">by a happy
inspiration</ins> Miss Anderson hit upon an idea that
brought the new school to the attention of the young
King Chulalongkorn. The sewing class was sewing
patches to make a quilt cover. It occurred to her that
a specimen of their product brought to the attention
of the king might demonstrate to him the practical
character of their school. Accordingly she had the
girls make a quilt from pieces of silk she had brought
from China, with the intention of presenting this to
the king on his birthday. Arrangements having been
made through the Foreign Office, Dr. and Mrs.
House, Miss Anderson and Miss Grimstead (another
assistant) were received by the king. After an address
of congratulations they presented the silk quilt
to him. His Majesty expressed his pleasure at the
compliment, and his gratification at having such a
specimen of the work being done by the girls of the
school. Droll as this incident may seem now—the
formal reception at royal court and the presentation,
to such an august personage, of a patch-work quilt
made by girls of a sewing class—yet the demonstration
made a favourable impression upon the progressive
ruler and won his sympathetic interest in the
educational work for girls newly undertaken by the
mission.</p>

<p>After learning the language Miss Anderson translated
several of Dr. Richard Newton’s addresses for
the young, under the title <cite>Bible Blessings</cite>. Mrs.
House and Miss Anderson went to Canton in 1875
for recuperation. There Miss Anderson met Rev.
Henry V. Noyes, a missionary under the Presbyterian
Board. The acquaintance led to an engagement, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
the two were married at Bangkok, Jan. 29, 1876.
Two years were spent in America in work for the
Chinese on the Pacific Coast, and then the couple returned
to China, where Mrs. Noyes co-operated with
her husband, especially conducting Bible schools for
women.</p>

<p>After the death of her husband, in 1914, she continued
to labour in China in a non-official capacity
until 1922, when she returned to America, having
served in the foreign mission work fifty years. One
son, Richard V. Noyes, died as he was about to enter
upon a missionary career; the other son, Rev. Wm. D.
Noyes, was for some years a missionary in China
under the Presbyterian Board. A sister of Mrs.
Noyes, Sarah Jean (1854-1902), graduated in 1875
from the Women’s Medical College of New York
and in 1877 sailed for China as a medical missionary
under the Presbyterian Board. Ill health compelled
her to resign two years later. Afterwards she married
Mr. Richard C. Brown and resided in England,
where she rendered valuable services for the cause
of temperance.</p>


<h3>BOARDING SCHOOL ESTABLISHED AT WANG LANG</h3>

<p>The first step necessary to establish the new boarding
school was to procure a suitable building. Space
at the mission compound did not permit of a new
building with room for future expansion. It so happened
that the mission had already purchased a piece
of land with the intention of opening a second station.
A residence had been begun but remained unfinished
for lack of funds. It was decided to turn
this property over to the school and complete the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
building with funds provided by the Troy Branch.
The locality was known as Wang Lang, a name which
attached itself to the school for several years. Concerning
this site Dr. House wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The location of the school is a fine one. It is central,
healthy and breezy; on the west bank of the noble
river Meinam, which rolls through the great city; opposite
to, but a quarter of a mile above, the Royal Palace,
where its buildings such as they are cannot but testify to
prince, noble and peasant as they pass by in their boats
of state or barges what Western Christian nations think
of female education. They also testify to the generosity
and friendship of the American church people.”</p>
</div>

<p>As soon as the building could be made ready Dr.
and Mrs. House and Miss Anderson moved to the
new location. On May 13, 1874, this first boarding
school for girls in Siam was opened with six boarders
and one day pupil. The building, originally intended
only for a residence, was none too commodious. The
basement contained kitchen, dining room and servants’
quarters; the first floor had a suite of three
rooms for Dr. and Mrs. House and one common
living room; on the second floor was one small sleeping
room for Miss Anderson and two large rooms
which served as school rooms by day and as dormitories
for the girls by night. Within a year a second
helper was added in the person of Miss Susie D.
Grimstead. By the second year twenty girls had enrolled,
living in these two rooms, rather small quarters
by American standards but ample according to
native custom.</p>

<p>In one regard Mrs. House was disappointed in her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
expectation. It had been her confident hope to attract
to this school daughters of some of the nobles
and princes. A few of this class came at first but
soon the school was left to the girls of the common
class. The value of an education was not yet as
highly valued among the higher classes as among the
lowly; for the women of the upper grades not only
had no need to read but no need to work; while on
the other hand the practical nature of the training
given in the school did not meet the requirements of
their social position. In later years, however, there
was a decided change, and with the growing popularity
of education nearly half of the pupils in the
school were from the noble families.</p>


<h3>LEAVING SIAM</h3>

<p>It was the lot of Mrs. House to do little more than
to inaugurate the new school, for her health rendered
a long period of service impossible. But in even
initiating the movement she did far more than she
realised at the time, for she was investing in the enterprise
an accumulation of experience and a wealth
of influence among the women of Bangkok such as no
one else possessed, and which gave the institution a
capital from which it began to draw immediate returns.
Such a school could not have been organised
by a new leader, however skilled in educational matters,
without long years of cultivation of personal
relations with the mothers and girls. One can see
now that Mrs. House’s return to Siam for another
trial of health had a higher wisdom than even she
could perceive; for while it seemed a daring of Providence,
it was in fact the wisdom of the great Teacher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
for her to expend the final momentum of her personal
prestige and thereby buy up a decade of time or
more at the expenditure of her last four years
of effort.</p>

<p>The return to Siam in 1872 found the climate less
kindly to her. Then came a new development, an
attack of asthma which lasted for nearly eight months,
so debilitating her as to render it necessary for her to
relinquish the cherished work into other hands. In
March, 1876, after twenty years of faithful, zealous
and labourious work for the Kingdom of God
among the women of Siam, she bade farewell to
her friends there and returned to America with her
husband.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Need I tell you that I left Siam with a sad, sad
heart? At the monthly concert this month my feelings
overcame me so that I felt as if I could not attend another
till I became more reconciled to the thought that I
can never again labour among the heathen. I think
many of the Siamese truly regretted our leaving. The
dear school girls followed us weeping to the landing, and
we could hear their sobs as long as we could see them
waving goodbye.</p>

<p>“Had I not felt it a case of life and death, I could not
have torn myself away. It was plain duty but it seemed
to me a dark providence that I should so soon be obliged
to leave this dear school, the result of so much labour
and prayer and of so many trials.”</p>
</div>


<h3>AN ESTIMATE OF HER WORK</h3>

<p>Mrs. House was so modest in the estimate of her
own work for women that she failed to appraise fully
what she had done. No doubt the meagerness of
results up to the time of her resignation and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
smallness of the achievement in comparison with her
hopes caused the whole to appear insignificant. None
of her letters give expression to the feeling of accomplishment
but dwell largely upon the great need
and the unappropriated opportunity. However, a
careful review of the development of education for
women in Siam gives to Mrs. House a very high
place among all the consecrated women who contributed
the labours of hand and head and heart to
that object. Without detracting one iota from the
praise that belongs to others, but rather reflecting light
upon their measure of honour, it may be said that to
Mrs. House belongs the credit for certain important
steps which marked the development and contributed
to the permanent establishment of female education
in Siam.</p>

<p>In the early attempts at educating girls in the homes
of the missionaries the aim in view was the conversion
of the girls, to which the education in reading
was incidental. Without minimising the value of education
as an agency for religion Mrs. House viewed
education as an object greatly to be desired in itself
with manifold advantages issuing from it, but especially
having an influence upon the whole social
status of womankind. A second factor utilised by
her for the development of her object was domestic
and manual training as a part of the broad policy of
education. Previously the few girls in the homes of
the missionaries had been trained in ways of work to
make them more efficient servants for the earning of
their keep, but there was no attempt to give instruction
of this character to others. Mrs. House included
domestic training in the scope of education. Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
she showed herself ready to appropriate valuable
ideas wherever she found them, and when she
saw that Mrs. McFarland later utilised this economic
factor to draw girls into her school at Petchaburi, she
readily adopted the same method.</p>

<p>But if the efforts of several missionary women to
teach small groups of girls may be likened to the
foundations of female education in Siam, then the
boarding school which Mrs. House established must
be likened to the corner-stone of the structure which
has since grown into a beautiful and impressive temple
of learning. Hitherto classes had been the voluntary
undertaking of individuals in their eagerness to
help their sisters out of darkness; but in each case the
undertaking was not a permanent project but subject
to termination with the removal of the particular
teacher. Mrs. House’s achievement at Wang Lang
was the establishment of an institution with a support
and a directorate that insured permanency.</p>

<p>In the voluntary classes the girls were in contact
with the teachers for a few hours at the most and
then returned to native environment to which they
were subject for the greater part of the time. It was
like taking one step forward and then stepping back.
The influence of the home and of the city largely
obstructed the good impulses received by the girls
while with their teachers. The advance feature of
the Wang Lang school was that the girls were to
remain under constant Christian influence, in frequent
contact with the teachers and subject to the daily
discipline of an ideal Christian home. While the girls
were devoting their full mental energy to study, the
Christian religion had the fairest chance to bear its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
fruit in ennobled character, free from the blighting
influence of pagan customs and morals.</p>

<p>As indicative of what this school meant for the
future educational program in Siam it is worthy of
note that twenty-five years after the establishment of
the Wang Lang school, the entire female teaching
force in the government public schools in Bangkok
were graduates of this school, thirteen in number, all
but one of whom were professing Christians. It is
no wonder, then, that the Minister of Education in
Siam, at a commencement of the school, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The Siamese formerly had a proverb which was in
every man’s mouth: ‘Woman is a buffalo; only man is
human.’ Through the influence of your school and the
teaching of the American Missionary women, we have
thrown that old proverb away, and our own government
is founding schools for the education of girls.”</p>
</div>

<p>As a mark of honour to the founder this school was
named “The Harriet House School for Girls,” a
name which it retained until successful growth made
it necessary to divide the school and seek new quarters;
the higher grades of which are now known as
“Wattana Wittaya Academy,” while the older name
still clings to the old school in its old location.</p>

HOME AGAIN, AND “HOME AT LAST”</h2>

<p class="drop-capy">The living pageant, “The Big Mountain and
the Little Chisel,” had not ended, but some of
the actors had to retire. Dr. House, who had
been in the leading rôle for twenty-nine years, and
Mrs. House, who had been his loyal understudy for
twenty, handed their lines to other willing players and
took their seats on the dais of time to watch the
Divine plot unfold. Repeated efforts on the part of
Mrs. House to recuperate her health only confirmed
the physician’s surmise that the immediate cause of
her suffering was the tropical climate. There was no
alternative of wisdom but to return to her native
clime. So it came about that Dr. and Mrs. House
resigned.</p>

<p>Their leave-taking was almost like laying down life
itself, for their hearts had become intimately entwined
with the lives of the Siamese people. In
March, 1876, the two sailed for “home again.” But
to return to America was not to abandon their zeal
for Siam; they made themselves ambassadors at large
to the Church in the United States in behalf of the
Kingdom of Christ in that land.</p>


<h3>REARING TWO SIAMESE LADS</h3>

<p>Most notable and doubtless most valuable of their
services for Siam after their retirement was the rearing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
and educating of two lads whom they had brought
from that country, Boon Itt and Nai Kawn. These
lads are still remembered by the people of Waterford
who were associated with them in their earlier years
in America. The story is told of the two boys having
their first experience with snow. One autumn morning,
finding that a light snow had fallen during the
night, the two went out into the back yard, dropped
down on their knees and began to feel the snow; and
then getting down on all fours touched it with their
tongues again and again. Among Mrs. House’s letters
was a copy of a letter which Kawn wrote to a
boy friend in Siam, in which he labours to explain
how the water of the river had become hard so that
he could walk on it with skates.</p>

<p>Boon Itt was the son of Maa Tuan, the matron of
the girls’ boarding school under Mrs. House. Dr.
and Mrs. House chose him to be the subject of a
Western education partly because he had shown himself
to be a bright pupil in the boys’ school, and partly
because he was one of the few children of second
generation Christian Siamese. After the completion
of his elementary education at Waterford, Boon was
sent to Williston Academy, Williams College, and
Auburn Theological Seminary. This long course of
education occupied seventeen years. In 1893 he returned
to Siam as a Christian missionary to his own
people. His life and work, worthy of an extended
account, will occupy a separate chapter.</p>

<p>The other lad, known familiarly as Nai Kawn in
America, was Kawn Amatyakul, born 1865, the son
of a nobleman Pra Pre Chah; and the grandson of
Kuhn Mote, one of the progressive nobles who early<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
formed a lasting friendship with Dr. House because
of their mutual interest in science. Before the boys’
boarding school had been fairly established, Kuhn
Mote placed his son under the tutorship of Dr. House
to learn English and chemistry. It was this son who,
as Pra Pre Chah, learning that his former tutor was
retiring to America, solicited Dr. House to take his
son Nai Kawn along and supervise his education in
Western science. To this Dr. House consented, with
the understanding that the son of the nobleman was to
be reared in a democratic fashion as a companion with
the son of a plebeian, and that he would be subject to
intensive religious training according to the Christian
faith.</p>

<p>After his preparatory education, Kawn entered
Lafayette College for a four years’ course in mining
engineering, though not as a candidate for a degree.
Finishing there in 1888, he returned to Siam early the
next year. His life work was devoted to the educational
program of the government, his professorial
labours being chiefly in chemistry and physics in
various schools and colleges of the government. At
length he became chief of the examination division
of the department of education. He was given the
title of Luang Vinich Vidyakarn in 1902; and some
years later was elevated to a higher rank with the title
Phya Vinich Vidyakarn.</p>

<p>Kawn united with the Presbyterian Church of
Waterford upon profession of faith in 1879. Although
he gave evidence of sincerity in making this
profession and in other ways manifested an earnest
purpose to live according to the teaching of Jesus, yet
it must be acknowledged that upon return to his native<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
land he did not identify himself with the native
church and eventually held himself altogether aloof
from fellowship with the Christians. No doubt one
cause for this course was the barrier of social rank.
His education and culture led him to prefer his own
class. On the other hand, it must be recorded that
he never made open repudiation of his profession, at
least in any formal manner, neither did he manifest
any antipathy to the Christian faith. His death occurred
April, 1922.</p>


<h3>ABUNDANT IN LABOURS TO THE END</h3>

<p>After her return to the United States, Mrs. House
became the center of a strong influence in behalf of
Siam among the women of the Church at home, especially
as an advocate for female education. In
1878 she was elected president of the Woman’s Presbyterian
Board of Foreign Missions of the Synod of
Albany and served five years in that capacity. When
the several small synods within New York were
united into the present Synod of New York, in 1883,
Mrs. House was a member of the committee that
planned for the consolidation of the several women’s
societies into the Woman’s Presbyterian Foreign Missionary
Society of New York Synod, and became the
first president of the consolidated organisation. As
a motto for the united society she proposed the ideal
“Every Woman in Every Church Working for
Jesus”—a motto that reads quite fresh to date. To
Mrs. House is due the credit of originating the series
of “Questions and Answers in Mission Fields,” beginning
with a catechism on the work in Siam for
children’s mission bands. This method of disseminating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
missionary information may possibly be the
germ from which has developed the current system
of mission study.</p>

<p>In the church at Waterford Mrs. House was accepted
as the natural leader in the foreign missionary
society of the women. She so developed interest in
the work that the society maintained a very high
standard of giving and of activities for many years.
She was particularly interested in cultivating an interest
in missions among the children and it was for
her own mission band that the series of questions and
answers were originally devised. Mrs. House had the
joyous satisfaction of seeing Boon Itt ready for work
in Siam. But before the time came for his departure
she was called upon to take leave of him for eternity.
On July 12, 1893, she passed to her rich reward in
Heaven.</p>

<p>With return to America, Dr. House continued his
activities in behalf of the Gospel at home and of
missions abroad. He embraced frequent opportunities
to preach, and especially responded with pleasure
to invitations for addresses on Siam. He had
accumulated a large collection of curios from Siam,
China and Japan, which he used with good effect
to illustrate his talks and interest his hearers. This
collection he left to the people of Waterford, and
it is in custody of the Presbyterian Church. In
the home church he took an active part, serving
for many years as trustee, and also as clerk and
treasurer of the board of trustees. He was honoured
by the community with election as President
of the village, an office which he held at the time of
his death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>


<h3>“ALL THINGS RICHLY TO ENJOY”</h3>

<p>When the two missionaries returned from their
long period of heavy labours in Siam with impaired
health it was with the expectation that the estate
which the doctor had received from his father would
provide sufficient income for a comfortable living.
The salary while on the field had been so small that
instead of being able to save from that income, the
doctor had to supplement it from his private purse.
But with economy, he expected that his patrimony
would be ample for the needs of himself and wife.
Not long after his return, however, it developed that
the investment of his funds was unsound, and he
suddenly found his reserves swept away. The two
were left largely dependent, though still having
their home.</p>

<p>Without a word of complaint they accepted the
situation as one of the inexplicable dispensations of
God. The many years of sublime but real trust in the
care of Providence which they had cultivated in the
mission field and which they had often proven to be
an unfailing means of blessing, now stood them in
good stead. Those who knew them intimately relate
instances in which what seemed to be spontaneous
gifts of friends and neighbours reached them at the
moment when they knew not whence a supply for
immediate needs was to come. In a letter to a friend
telling of the timely provision of the Lord for his
needs, Dr. House wrote that his old friend Kuhn
Mote, having learned of his straitened circumstances,
had sent him a gift of five hundred dollars. If the
record of those later years could be written it would
be a continuous testimony to the simple reliance upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
the goodness and mercy of God, and to the marvellous
justification of the faith of this godly couple.</p>


<h3>THE JUBILEE YEAR</h3>

<p>When, in 1897, the Presbyterian Board of Foreign
Missions celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the
beginning of permanent work in Siam, the doctor was
the only survivor of the group who met together in
Bangkok half-a-century before. None of the workers
in the field doubtless had greater rejoicing at that
jubilee than Dr. House. The following letter of felicitation
he wrote on that occasion to the daughter
of his fellow missionary, herself born in Siam and
from childhood knowing him as “Uncle Samuel”; it
was a delicate tribute to the memory of his companions
in labours.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Waterford, New York</span>, March 18, 1897.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<em>To Miss Mary L. Mattoon</em>:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Mary</span>:</p>

<p>“You will excuse the familiarity of my address when
you learn why my heart just now goes out to you with
affectionate interest. You are the child, the Siam-born
child of the honoured, now sainted missionary
couple who with my unworthy self just fifty years
ago, March 22, 1847, after eight months of weary voyage,
landed in Bangkok and founded the present prosperous
mission of the Presbyterian Board in the
Kingdom of Siam. Yes, the coming Monday, the 22nd,
will be the fiftieth birthday of that mission, and 1897
is its jubilee year.</p>

<p>“How vivid are the memories of that never-to-be-forgotten
day of our arrival, our welcome from the old
missionaries of the other Boards, our first impressions of
our strange yet interesting surroundings; and of the
busy week and month and years that followed; and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
work for the Master, with our full share of the peculiar
joys and sorrows, trials and disappointments of
mission life! How all the mercies come thronging into
my mind.</p>

<p>“And what cause for gratitude that God has so honoured
the humble beginning with such glorious results
in these later days. ‘The little one has indeed become a
thousand’; yes, thousands now of baptised converts from
heathenism are rejoicing in Siam and Laos in the knowledge
and the love of Christ who, had that mission not
been begun and watched over and prayed over by those
godly devoted parents of yours and their associate
(would he had been a wiser and better man), would
have lived and died without God and without hope, in
the darkness of Buddhistic idolatry and atheism.</p>

<p>“To God be all glory given! Well may a jubilee be
kept by all who know of the contrast between that day
in Siam and the present. What wonders God hath
wrought.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr4">“Sincerely yours,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">S. R. House</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps it was the celebration of this jubilee in
Siam that reminded former pupils of the Bangkok
boys’ school of how much they were indebted to Dr.
House for the immeasurable difference between their
Christian enlightenment and the paganism around
them. At any rate in the following summer Dr.
House received from a group of his former pupils a
gift of one hundred and twenty-five dollars, accompanied
by this letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Sumray, Bangkok</span>, June 15, 1898.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<em>The Rev. S. R. House, M.D.</em>:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: We have learned that your old age coming to
eighty-one on the 16th of October next. On the occasion
we are glad to subscribe among your oriental scholars of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
Siam to offer you a small present, which we obtained for
your birthday.</p>

<p>“We herewith request you to accept this small sum
for your birthday present for the recognition of your
Siamese scholars, and we beg to thank you for the
knowledgment which we obtained from you when you
were with us in our lovely country. And we noted you
were the foundation of our knowledgment, and we will
place your name on the stone of our hearts as long as
we live.</p>

<p>“We pray God to bless you, to comfort and to help
you in all circumstances; and we hope to meet you again
in the Kingdom of our Father.</p>

<p>“We have the honour to remain, Sir, your affectionate
scholars.”</p>

<p class="right">(Signed by twenty-eight former pupils.)</p>
</div>

<p>But that birthday never arrived. Only a few days
after the receipt of this affectionate token and grateful
testimonial, Dr. House took leave forever from
his friends of Siam and from his friends of all the
world. On the thirteenth day of October, 1898, he
reached <em>Home At Last</em>.</p>

<p>His affection for Siam outlived his days; for he
had provided a small bequest for the Harriet House
school in memory of his wife. Dr. House and his
wife lie buried in the Waterford Rural Cemetery.</p>

BOON TUAN BOON ITT</h2>


<p class="drop-capy pbot15">“One of the most remarkable men I have met
in Asia.” Such was the characterisation of
Boon Itt given by Dr. Arthur J. Brown,
Secretary of the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions,
after a visit to the Far East. Only when one
considers the high quality of the well-educated native
leaders in the Christian church in Japan or China will
this estimate suggest its full measure. Nor does this
evaluation exceed the common esteem in which Boon
Itt was held by those who knew him while in
America. By all his fellow students and by his teachers
he was regarded as a man of exceptionally fine
personality, of high moral ideals, and of rare Christian
attainments.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp70" id="i_230a">
<img class="w80" src="images/i_230a.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center pbot15"><span class="smcap">Rev.</span> BOON TUAN BOON ITT</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In physique he was of medium stature, well proportioned,
lithe of limb and agile in action. He was
fond of athletics, and showed a preference for the
more active sports. He loved games for the sake of
sport rather than for the winning chance. His
features were distinctly Asiatic. Yet there was a total
absence of that mysteriousness in countenance which
we usually associate with the Oriental. Americans
quickly lost sight of the difference of race, and received
him as one of their own. His voice was low,
mellow and gently modulated, imparting a feeling of
confidence by its quiet yet positive strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>The most casual acquaintance discovered in him a
winsomeness of manners. Simple, courteous, modest,
responsive, he had all the marks of a Christian gentleman.
He was friendly but free from effusiveness;
hospitable yet without aggressiveness in urging attentions.
He had a warm sympathy but never bestowed
the pity of superiority nor the flattery of patronage.
His love of companions made him a leader among
young men. In his nature the æsthetic had its proper
balance. He possessed a love of the beautiful both
in art and in nature, and in this love he found a constant
inspiration to purity and nobleness. The best
in literature and in art and in music found a response
in his heart. Without doubt, however, to those who
knew Boon Itt best, it was the spiritual quality that
gave richness to his character. He was deeply religious;
he had a religiousness of soul rather than of
mind, free from the sentimental, the spectacular or the
trivial. Faith with him was not a matter of creed
but of simple, profound trust in a God whose goodness
he had proven.</p>


<h3>“THE FAITH THAT DWELT IN THY GRANDFATHER”</h3>

<p>Boon Itt was one of the earliest of the second generation
Christians of Siam. His maternal grandfather
was Kee-Eng Sinsay Quasien. This name
appears in various abbreviations and spellings in Dr.
House’s journal, but here it is given in the form approved
by one of his grandsons, who explains that the
first two syllables constitute the name, while the remainder
is the title. It will not lessen the honour to
correct several traditions that have attached themselves
to his story in America. Kee-Eng was not the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
first Protestant Christian in Siam, nor the first convert
of the Presbyterian Mission; his wife did not
make a profession of Christian faith; his daughter
Maa Tuan was not the first Siamese woman to
unite with the Christian church. His primacy was
only that he was the first “native” to be received
into the Presbyterian Church of Bangkok after its
organisation.</p>

<p>Kee-Eng was baptised Jan. 7, 1844, by Rev.
Stephen Johnston, of the A. B. C. F. M., having been
the Chinese tutor to Mr. Johnston for several years;
but there had been other converts previously. When
the A. B. C. F. M. abandoned Siam and turned their
work over to the Presbyterians, Kee-Eng was the only
one of their converts still in Siam in good standing;
and he was transferred to the Presbyterian Church.
On this occasion Dr. House reported:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Kwa Kieng is a native of middle age (about forty-five),
good education, was formerly Mr. Johnston’s
teacher, of respectable appearance, amiable character and
appears for five years back to have led a faithful and
exemplary life as a disciple of Christ. He has a wife
(a Cambodian woman) and three children—two sons
and a daughter [another son and daughter were born
later]—now living at Rapri, one hundred miles west of
Bangkok. Though he speaks Siamese imperfectly, we
can communicate tolerably well with him, and we feel
that Providence may make him the instrument of great
good to many of his countrymen. He would be well
equipped in many respects for a native assistant, and we
have confidence in him.”</p>
</div>

<p>In his <cite>Journal</cite> at this time Dr. House states that
Kee-Eng was a Hakien Chinaman from Amoy. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
reference to Cambodia in connection with his wife
must be taken to indicate only that she came from
there. Her name was Maa Hey and, according to her
son Kru Tien Soo, she was the daughter of a Chinese,
born in Cambodia. Although, according to her son,
Maa Hey never made a profession of the Christian
faith; yet she did manifest a sympathy with the work
of the mission. All the children of the family were
baptised at the request of the father.</p>

<p>As early as 1848 Dr. House mentions that Kee-Eng
conducted a school for Chinese boys at Ratburi, or
Rapri, as he spells it. When the boys’ boarding school
was established in Bangkok he was chosen as the
teacher of Chinese. For this reason he removed his
family to Bangkok and came to live in the compound.
Besides teaching he conducted weekly worship for his
fellow countrymen, served as interpreter for Dr.
House while he taught the Bible class of Chinese, and
still later had charge of a mission chapel for the
Chinese. Kee-Eng died Nov. 23, 1858, a victim of
the cholera.</p>


<h3>“AND IN THY MOTHER TUAN”</h3>

<p>Maa Tuan was the elder daughter of Kee-Eng. At
the time the family moved to Bangkok she was about
five years old, according to Dr. House. She early became
a member of the girls’ class in the home of Mrs.
Stephen Mattoon, and was intimately associated with
the girls whom Mrs. Mattoon had adopted. After the
father died the family returned to their former home
at Bangpa near Ratburi, where they were separated
from Christian influences except for an occasional
visit of a missionary. Here Maa Tuan married Chin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
Boon Sooie. To this marriage three children were
born, Boon Itt, Boon Yee, and Prasert, a daughter
who died in infancy. Concerning Chin Boon Sooie
little is to be found recorded, aside from what Dr.
House states in the letter quoted below. His nationality
is there given as Siamo-Chinese, and this is confirmed
by his son, who also is the authority that his
father never made a profession of Christian faith.
Chin Boon Sooie died in 1873.</p>

<p>Concerning Maa Tuan the first important mention
by Dr. House was in a letter to Mrs. House in 1872,
who was then in America:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Among those present [i.e., at the communion service]
were some of your old pupils: one, speaks of you
with much affection, Tuan the eldest daughter of Sinsay
and Maa Hey, her mother. Tuan is now making her
first visit to Bangkok since she left our command. She
evidently has made an efficient and intelligent woman;
reads English quite well yet; has rather a superior husband,
a kind of a headman (man of property at least)
at Bangpa—unfortunate in business of late but credit
unimpaired.</p>

<p>“Poor Tuan since her last babe was born has been
running down and is poor and sallow just now—she
always was short in stature.... Had not Tuan married
a well-to-do trader her knowledge of books, arithmetic
and sewing might be utilised to the good of the
cause. She might be hired to get up in her native
village a day school.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the following year, probably after the death of her
husband, we find her moving with her children to
Sumray, near Bangkok, where the mission school was
located, in order that she might have educational advantages
for her children, for at that period the mission<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
school was the only means to a modern education.
In November of 1873 she united with the Church
upon profession of faith.</p>

<p>When Mrs. House opened the girls’ boarding school
at Wang Lang, Maa Tuan was engaged as matron
and teacher. Concerning her work in this school Miss
M. L. Cort writes in her book on Siam:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“This school has had the advantage of the faithful
and constant services of Maa Tuan who is an exceptional
Siamese woman and was educated and trained for
her position by Mrs. House.... She has been the chief
native teacher and matron for the school ever since it
began, and the interpreter between the new missionaries
and the old pupils, as she understands English very well.
It is through her influence that many of the pupils have
been secured and retained. She is dignified and kind;
and each year adds to her wisdom and usefulness.”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Maa Tuan spent the summer of 1880 teaching women
in the royal palace by request. For some years she
conducted a private school at Wang Lang, and so far
as records show she was the first Siamese woman to
conduct such a school.</p>

<p>While her son was in America, Maa Tuan wrote to
Mrs. House that she often rose at midnight to pray
that Boon might become a good Christian and become
a preacher to his own people. When the news came
to her that her son had been converted and had united
with the church in far away America, her cup was
overrunning with joy. She died in 1899.</p>


<h3>THE BOY BOON ITT</h3>

<p>Boon Tuan Boon Itt was born February 15, 1865,
in the village of Bangpa, which was a Chinese settlement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
near Ratburi. After his mother removed to
Bangkok with her children, Boon Itt and his younger
brother Boon Yee entered the mission school and
there began their primary education. Only three
years after that, Dr. and Mrs. House resigned. When
they were about to return home they arranged to take
Boon with them and undertook to have him educated
in America. At the same time the retiring missionaries
agreed to supervise the education of another
Siamese boy, Nai Kawn, at the request of his father.</p>

<p>Rev. J. A. Eakin, D.D., in his sketch of Boon Itt,
gives this touching picture of the night before his
departure:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The warm clothing, so different from anything that
he had been accustomed to wear, was all made and
packed in his little box. He had taken leave of his
teacher and the school. On the morrow he was to leave
his native land. On that last night his mother visited
him, and sitting together in their favorite place by the
riverside, they talked long of the future. Years afterward,
when he was a student of Theology, in a letter to
his mother he referred to that night, and said that her
farewell words of counsel had always remained in his
mind, and had been a great help to him.”</p>
</div>

<p>The home of Dr. and Mrs. House was to be in
Waterford, New York, and thither they brought their
young charges. Boon early became imbued with the
American idea of self-dependence. He sought to
learn to do as American boys do. In vacation time
he looked for jobs to earn money towards his own
support. When Dr. and Mrs. House assumed the
responsibility for his education, they supposed that
their income would be sufficient to bear the expense;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
but with the failure of their investments a serious
problem confronted them. Fortunately, Boon won
his way into the hearts of the people, so that the
Presbyterian Sunday school of Waterford undertook
to make an annual contribution of seventy-five dollars,
and continued this amount until his full course was
finished. Individuals also assisted privately.</p>


<h3>EDUCATION</h3>

<p>The barrier of language of course had first to be
removed. For this reason his studies were begun
with private teaching. In the course of her visits to
missionary societies, Mrs. House made an address at
North Granville, New York, and there told of the
boys they had brought to America to educate. This
address, as will be observed in a letter of Boon’s that
follows later, prompted a generous offer on the part
of Mr. Wallace C. Willcox, principal of the military
academy at that place, to give free tuition to Boon Itt,
provided friends would care for his needs. This offer
was gladly accepted, and in January, 1880, Boon and
Kawn entered the academy.</p>

<p>In the fall, Mr. Willcox transferred his relations to
the military school at Mohegan Lake, New York, and
his personal interest in the two boys carried them with
him, so that for that academic year Boon was at
Mohegan. In the fall of 1881, he was sent to Williston
Seminary, Northampton, Massachusetts, to prepare
for college. There he distinguished himself for
brightness of mind and fondness of athletics, particularly
swimming—in which art every normal boy of
Bangkok is an adept from childhood. Graduating at
Williston, in the fall of 1885 he matriculated at Williams<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
College. There he spent four years, pursuing
the classical course, and graduated with the degree
A.B. in 1889.</p>

<p>The college course finished, there came to him one
of those severe tests of his consecration and high
sense of duty that marked his life at intervals. Between
medicine and the ministry he hesitated, but
only to weigh in his mind which of the two professions
would be the one in which he could render the
greatest good to his native land. Of the need of
medicine there could be no doubt; even a young man
could perceive the advantage of modern medical
science for a land where ignorance of the body and
superstition were the allies to cause suffering, contagion
and pestilence. He could well appreciate also
the value of the gentle art of healing as a means of
winning the people’s attention while others might
preach the Gospel to them. It was no small tribute to
the greater power of the ministry in his judgment,
therefore, that he resolved to prepare himself for
that profession because he deemed the Gospel itself
the greatest need for his countrymen.</p>

<p>Having decided for the ministry he entered the
Theological Seminary at Auburn, New York. There
his grace of meekness, coupled with sterling worth,
won for him a high place in the esteem of both his
fellow students and the faculty. He had no ambition
to be a popular leader, and yet in spite of his retiring
disposition he was the center of a warm fellowship
because of his high ideals. During the summer vacation
of 1890 he served a parish at Bad Axe, Michigan,
and in the next summer was the acting pastor
at Bergen, New York. He graduated from the seminary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
in May, 1892, and on the eleventh of the same
month was ordained to the Gospel ministry by the
Presbytery of Rochester. In that year also he acquired
American citizenship. While awaiting the
matter of appointment to the field, he took a post-graduate
course at Auburn, at the same time supplying
the Presbyterian Church at Manlius, N. Y.</p>


<h3>HIS SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT</h3>

<p>The spiritual development of Boon Itt, including
both the obstacles surmounted and the high attainments,
will not be rightly appreciated until one considers
the environment of his early childhood. Maa
Tuan left the mission compound at Bangkok upon
the death of her father, and returned to Bangpa with
the family. She was then about fifteen years old
and had not yet taken a public stand for Christianity,
although there is every evidence that the period of
her Christian training at the mission more than
counterbalanced the pagan influence of the years that
immediately followed. None of the family were
Christians, and the constraint of custom would involve
them in religious practises in common with the
neighbourhood. Then marrying an unbelieving husband,
the young woman could not effectually exclude
those influences from the life of her own children,
even though her husband might have been tolerant of
the Christian faith. Like children the world over,
hers were susceptible to the subtle influences of the
religion that prevailed in the village. So it happened
that during the first eight years of his life, the most
impressionable period of childhood, Boon observed
the religious customs of Buddhism, the festivals, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
parades, the birthday celebrations, the funerals, and at
the same time would unconsciously absorb the ideas
of this religious environment. It will not be surprising,
therefore, if we find later that some of these
ideas had taken deep root in his mind.</p>

<p>Upon entering the mission school he came under a
more exclusively Christian atmosphere. Concerning
his reaction to this condition, Dr. Eakin writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The religious side of his nature developed slowly.
The seed sown by his mother’s teaching had not yet
taken root in his heart.... He was regular in attendance
in Sunday school and church. He went to the midweek
meeting as the boys of the school were expected to
do. His lessons were well learned because he delighted
in study and he would not disappoint his mother; but
his soul was still in the dark.”</p>
</div>

<p>At once upon reaching Waterford, Boon enrolled
in the Sunday school and continued faithful in attendance
until he left for boarding school. On his
return home during vacations he resumed his accustomed
place in the village church with Dr. and Mrs.
House. During this earlier period he united with the
Presbyterian Church Dec. 7, 1879, under the pastorate
of Rev. A. B. Riggs, D.D. The following letter,
written by Boon to his mother at that time, has recently
come to light:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Waterford</span>, Jan. 5, 1880.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>:</p>

<p>“It is a long time before we get letters from each
other. I hope you are getting along nicely in the school.
I am well and happy.</p>

<p>“I have something to tell you. I think God has answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
your prayers for my conversion. I have given
my heart to Christ, and own Him to be my God and
Redeemer forevermore. I have joined the Presbyterian
Church. Pray for me to be obedient and faithful to
what I have promised. At first I dreaded to join before
so many people, but when I had done it I felt a great
deal happier. When church was out some folks shook
hands with me and said they were very glad to have me
join. I hope I will see grandmother, uncles, aunts, my
brother and all the folks become Christians; then if we
do not meet each other here on earth we would meet in
the other world....</p>

<p>“A gentleman by the name of Willcox has a military
school at Granville, about sixty miles north of Waterford,
and the board and schooling is four hundred dollars
a year. He made a great offer to Mrs. House to take me
free, if she would provide my clothes and books and
expenses in vacation from June to September. And now
in about two days more Kawn and I are going up there.</p>

<p>“The folks in Dr. House’s family say that they will
miss us very much, and we are sorry to leave them. Is
this not a wonderful thing that the Lord brought about
for us to go to this school? It all came about in this
way. Mrs. House went and talked to the ladies of
Granville and told them about Siam, and told them about
us. No other boys ever had such an offer as this. Then
a few kind ladies of Waterford gave us sheets, pillowcases,
towels and other things that we will need.</p>

<p>“It all came of the Lord, so blessed be His name forever.
Give my love to all.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr2">“Your affectionate son,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Boon Itt</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>In spite of the devout expressions in this youthful
letter, Boon privately intimated to friends that he had
not altogether given up the religion of his native land.
One who knew him well recalls that Boon said he still
believed Buddhism in his heart and that he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
return to it when he went back to Siam. Upon being
asked why he then had made a profession of Christianity
he said it was because Dr. Houses’ life was
“so terrible”—by which he explained that the godly
character of Dr. House overcame all his arguments
against Christianity. He could not contemplate all
that Dr. House was doing for him in the name of
Christ and at the same time deny the Christian religion.
His love for the doctor impelled him to declare
for Christ.</p>

<p>Recalling now the influences of his early childhood,
it will be evident that his private expression did not
signify duplicity but rather indicated the presence of
vague but unsolved problems. When a child who has
been reared in a wholly Christian environment becomes
converted, that process is chiefly a spiritual
change. But for one brought up in the midst of
pagan influences to change his religion means to
change his entire character, ethical principles and
even his theory of existence. Somewhere between
these two extremes was the condition of Boon at the
time of his joining the Church. His conviction concerning
the Christian religion, encouraged by the influence
of his dearest friends, enabled him to make a
confession of faith. But his heart outran his head.
In his mind there were still unexpressed but perplexing
questions.</p>

<p>The nature of one of these questions is shown by
an incident quoted by Dr. Eakins:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“At one time, in his sophomore year, if my memory
serves me correctly, he went to call upon the minister
who served as pastor to the students, and the minister<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
asked him to tell of any special difficulties he found in
the way of becoming a professor of religion. After a
thoughtful pause Mr. Boon Itt said that his chief difficulty
was that he could not see that there was a personal
God. The minister thought that he was caviling, and he
reproved him for trifling with the truth. From that time
on the minister had lost his opportunity to do the young
student any good in a spiritual way. Sometime afterward,
through the gracious operation of the Holy Spirit
in his heart, he was brought to see that truth, to recognise
the love of God in Christ, and to accept salvation
through the Cross. It had been a long slow process, as
it is usually with the Siamese, but it was complete. He
was convinced beyond the possibility of a doubt, and he
made a full surrender of himself to do his Master’s will.”</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the incident referred to occurred during
the period of religious awakening among the students
of Williams College, which took place while
Boon was there. The common spiritual invigoration
reacted with unusual power upon the individual whose
mind was seeking light. That revival served to
quicken his spiritual life and enabled him to make
safely the transition from the youthful stage of habit
and training, across the frail bridge of doubt that
spanned the chasm of unbelief. By it he entered into
a conscious experience of grace and assumed a volitioned
course of life directed by personal devotion to
Jesus Christ. The seed of the Gospel planted by
maternal teaching and nurtured by the affectionate
training of foster parents now, under the warmth of
the Spirit and the dew of holy emotions, flowered
into a full-blown religious character of rare beauty
and fragrance. How real that conversion was is indicated
by the reply which Boon gave to a fellow-student<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
in the seminary who, interested to know what
might be the sense of sin for a man while still in
paganism, inquired of him what his experience had
been; to which he replied, “I did not know that I had
sin until I became a Christian.”</p>


<h3>APPOINTMENT TO THE FIELD</h3>

<p>Having made ready for return to Siam, Boon Itt
met another severe test of his consecration in the
question of appointment by the Foreign Board. Unfortunately
the problem was made more difficult for
him by the very kindly intentions of his friends in
America who apparently did not recognise the fundamental
principle involved. As the work in foreign
lands had developed it had become the policy of mission
Boards to magnify the native church, and to place
upon it as rapidly as possible the increasing responsibility
for managing its own affairs, as distinguished
from the affairs of the missions. The development of
a strong native church in each country necessitated
that ordained natives should share, not the supposed
advantages of foreign missionaries, but the actual
conditions of their fellow native Christians. For
this reason, along with others of a kindred nature,
the Board had arrived at the policy not to commission
as a missionary any native, however well qualified.
Provision was made that the mission in the
field might employ such workers according to their
judgment.</p>

<p>While, therefore, the Board declined to issue a
“commission” to Boon Itt they heartily recommended
him to the mission in Siam for appointment on equality
with his fellow Siamese Christian workers. That<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
the principle involved is wise finds testimony in the
words of Boon Itt himself who, when he reached a
position of leadership, said: “To make Siam completely
Christian must be ultimately the work of the
Siamese Christian Church, self-supporting, self-directing
and responsible to God—not dependent
always on foreign missions.”</p>


<h3>RETURN TO SIAM</h3>

<p>The matter of appointment having been adjusted,
Boon Itt returned to his native land in the summer of
1893. Upon return it was necessary for him first to
qualify himself in his native language. Not only had
it been seventeen years—the major part of his life—since
he had withdrawn from the daily use of his
mother tongue, but his training in that language had
been arrested when he was a lad of eleven. His
higher education had been in a foreign language so
that his religious conceptions were framed in words
that must find an equivalent in the Siamese. During
this period of language study he was occupied in
many ways in the work of the mission, assisting with
the literary work of the mission press, accompanying
others on mission tours, and temporarily having
charge of stations while missionaries were on vacations.
On September 20, 1897, he married his cousin,
Maa Kim Hock, a graduate of the Harriet House
School.</p>

<p>It was shortly after his engagement that a flattering
offer came to him to turn aside from religious work
and enter business. Dr. House, writing to a friend
under date of Nov. 25, 1896, says: “A letter from
Boon tells me of his having declined an engagement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
of five hundred dollars a month (he now has only five
hundred dollars a year from the mission), as he prefers
his present work, which he loves and enjoys and
has been blessed in.”</p>

<p>The proffer of so large a salary might well have
been sufficient inducement to a young man to abandon
the less lucrative business of preaching. But upon
consulting his fiancée she replied: “I think we would
be far happier doing the Lord’s work on a little money
than to leave it for so large a sum.” But that was
not the only tempting offer that came to him. After
Boon’s death the Minister of the Interior disclosed
that he himself had offered to Boon Itt “a position
which would have led to high titles of nobility from
the King of Siam, to the governorship of a province
and to a large increase in income.”</p>

<p>Compared with these offers, a salary of five hundred
dollars was indeed a pittance for a college graduate,
even with the extra allowances. The larger
salary of eight hundred and fifty dollars which he was
receiving at the time of his death was an economic injustice
compared with commercial salaries. But it
needs only be observed that all missionaries suffered
the same injustice. An American missionary in the
same country at the same time was receiving only
one thousand one hundred and thirty dollars, although
he had a family and had served more than twice as
long as Boon Itt. Since then the scale of salaries has
been raised, and graduated according to the length of
service; but it is still true that a missionary receives
barely enough for a living. But the marvel of this
comparison is not the disparity of pay but the readiness
of Boon Itt to renounce such dazzling offers and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
to hold himself true to the work of preaching the
Gospel to which he had devoted himself.</p>


<h3>PITSANULOKE</h3>

<p>Shortly after marriage the young couple were assigned
with W. B. Toy, M.D., and family to open a
new field at Pitsanuloke, some two hundred and fifty
miles up the Meinam River. While Dr. Toy was to
establish a hospital, funds for which were to be provided
by the Board, Boon Itt was to open a school.
Through the good offices of public officials he secured
the temporary use of some government building.</p>

<p>Concerning this enterprise Dr. Eakin writes
vividly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“He began work in a small way, but he did it thoroughly.
In a few months he had attracted attention of
the government authorities. They began to send their
sons to the school.... It was a slow process of
growth but it was indigenous from the start. In this
respect it was typical of all Boon Itt’s work. He tried
to work with the Siamese people from the inside out,
instead of following the common method of applying
something foreign largely on the outside.</p>

<p>“It required rare self-sacrifice in Mr. Boon Itt to
labour on, teaching the rudiments of learning in that
little school when he felt that he was capable of doing
a work that would loom larger in the public view....
But there was a subtler temptation in the opportunity
to do a work that would make a greater show before
the world. He had warm friends at home [America]
who were rising in business and professional life. An
appeal to them would have enabled him to make his
school a more immediate and manifest success....
He felt the cost in his very soul, when he turned his
back upon that temptation; but he decided that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
slow indigenous work was the only way to secure
permanence.</p>

<p>“The work has gone forward in Pitsanuloke since
those days. A church has been organised there which
promises well; but the present prosperity owes much to
the patient digging and laying foundations out of sight,
which was done by Mr. Boon Itt.”</p>
</div>

<p>After a time the government had use for the building
and it became necessary to seek other quarters for
the school. Boon Itt leased a new site of about ten
acres on the west bank of the river adjacent to the
barracks, at a nominal price. As the Board had no
funds available for a building he personally secured
subscriptions from local merchants and officials
amounting to four thousand ticals (two thousand dollars),
besides lumber and building materials. A plain
but substantial two-story school building of teak
wood was erected under his personal supervision and
partly by the labour of his own hands.</p>

<p>The enrollment of the first year was forty boys, of
whom twenty-six were boarders. The average attendance
for that year was ninety-five per cent. In
the competitive examinations later the boys of this
school gained the highest standing over the boys of
the government public school and the Royal Survey
school. One of the notable features of his work was
the influence he exerted over the young men personally.
No doubt that influence in a measure was due
to the manner of his religious teaching. He himself
has described his method:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“As I have men who study Christianity I have to
spend a good deal of time formulating what are the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
fundamental doctrines of Christianity. We can use
phrases in the States and be understood.... Here it
is <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">de novo</span></i>. I use no text-book. I do not know of any.
I endeavour to analyse as honestly as I know how myself
and use my experience as a guide—not as an
infallible guide, but only as a working basis.”</p>
</div>

<p>This plan which he adopted was essentially the
apostolic method. In our emphasis on the inspiration
of the letters written by the apostles we are likely to
overlook the fact that they are discussing spiritual
truths out of their own lives; their epistles are “text
books” written out of experience under the guidance
of the Holy Spirit. Boon Itt was following the same
method so far as he could.</p>

<p>In addition to being superintendent of the school,
he regularly conducted the Sabbath preaching service,
worked in the Sunday school, and made a tour of
exploration as far north as the Lao border. His
wife had charge of a girls’ school which she had organised.
Pitsanuloke was formally organised and
recognised as a regular station in 1899.</p>


<h3>TRANSFER TO BANGKOK</h3>

<p>In 1901, Boon Itt was given a six-months leave of
absence for recuperation. He had planned to spend
his furlough in Japan; but yielding to family interests
he got no farther than his old home in Bangkok. Just
before returning to his field, in January, 1902, the
Bangkok Christian community presented an earnest
petition to have Mr. Boon Itt remain in Bangkok and
take charge of a new work which it was proposed
to open.</p>

<p>The demand for his services came about as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
culmination of circumstances. The work at Sumray
had become too large for the plot of land laid out
nearly forty years before. A new compound had been
procured in the city proper, and the mission Press
had already been moved thither. A campus for a
boys’ high school had also been secured in that locality
and buildings were soon to be erected. On the
part of a few there was a desire to establish a church
near the school as a center for work among the students.
This led to a movement among the Siamese
Christians to have this church erected by the Siamese
for the Siamese to the honour of Christ. A Christian
nobleman of wealth and influence offered to give the
major part of the cost, and the remainder was to be
raised by the native Christians. This nobleman was
Phra Montri, now Phya Sarasin. As he had a high
admiration for Boon Itt and wished his help and
leadership in the project, a conference was called at
which it was unanimously decided to undertake the
enterprise and to ask to have Boon Itt transferred
from Pitsanuloke to take charge of the work; and a
committee consisting of Phra Montri, Kru Yuan,
pastor of the First Church of Bangkok, and Boon Itt
was appointed to secure a lot near the proposed high
school and to plan for the new structure.</p>

<p>Concerning this project and the peculiar fitness of
Boon Itt for it, Dr. Arthur J. Brown, Secretary of
the Board of Foreign Missions, who at that time was
making a visit to the Siam mission, gave a very vivid
survey in his report to the Board. After describing
the respective locations of the three churches in the
capital city and the circumstantial limitation of their
reach, he says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Thus there is neither missionary nor church in
Bangkok for the bulk of the population, for the intelligent,
well-to-do classes who are becoming eagerly interested
in foreign ideas, and for the thousands of
bright young men who flock to the metropolis in Siam,
as they do in England and America. In that main part
of the city there are scores of young men and women
who were educated at our boarding schools. Many of
them are Christians. I met a big room full of them at
a reception which they very kindly gave in my honour.
They were as fine a looking company of young people
as I have met anywhere on this tour. Properly led they
might be a power for Christ.</p>

<p>“But there is absolutely no place in all Bangkok
where they can attend church unless they divide up by
sexes and travel several miles in a boat to Sumray and
Wang Lang. This some of them do, but their parents
and friends do not. Every year our schools are sending
out more of these young people, but we are not
following them up, and they are left to drift.... For
this great work a man and a church are needed at once.
No other need in Siam is more urgent. The man
should be able to speak the Siamese like a native. He
should be conversant with the intricacies of Siamese
customs and etiquette; and so understand the native
mind that he can enter into sympathy with it and be
able to mould it for God.</p>

<p>“There is one man in Siam who meets all these conditions.
I believe that he has ‘come into the kingdom
for such a time as this.’ That man is Rev. Boon Boon
Itt ... one of the most remarkable men I have met in
Asia. His station has been Pitsanuloke, where he has
done a fine work in building up next to the largest
boys’ boarding school in the mission. Another man can
do the work at Pitsanuloke equally well, but no other
man in Siam or out of it can reach the young men in
Bangkok as he can. As the head of his ‘clan’ whose
family home is in Bangkok, he is widely and favourably
known in the capital. Young men like him and resort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
to him for advice whenever he visits the city.... We
can use this man to better advantage for the cause of
Christ. So I proposed to the missionaries that Mr.
Boon Itt be transferred to Bangkok, and the proposal
was unanimously and enthusiastically agreed to.”</p>
</div>

<p>So it came about that Boon Itt was unexpectedly
but with great reluctance persuaded to accept the call
to Bangkok. In a letter to a friend in America he
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Now there comes a call for me to come down to
Bangkok and take up the work here with young men
and for young men. This now seems to be my work.
I am drawn to it now. I was not before; I looked at
it from a sheer sense of duty. I want to put my best
work in down here, for it is extremely important to
build up homes if purity is ever to be indigenous.
When I went up to Pitsanuloke I was in doubt about
the school work, so I said to the Lord if He wanted me
to start a school there, would He give the money
wherewith to build it. He owns all the riches of the
world and people’s hearts are in his hands; so I asked
Him to influence the people there to give the money
and the materials—and He did, and the school has
been built.</p>

<p>“Well, I learned one other lesson along with that,
viz: that had I asked the Father to give me money for
the work in His own way I would have been spared
much unnecessary toil. I am certain that the Lord will
give me the money to carry on this new work out here.
My plan in general is to hire a building and start a
reading room, play room, prayer meeting room, where
we can have classes for Bible studies.”</p>
</div>

<p>As the possibilities unfolded themselves to his mind
it was not solely the undertaking to build up a congregation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
that engaged his interests. He sketched plans
for work in connection with the church which would
make it a center of social activities for the cultivation
of Christian ideals among the young men; and it was
this phase of the work which appealed to him. He
studied the needs both temporal and spiritual.
Through his influence the young men organised an
institution known as the Christian United Bank of
Siam; this was the first banking house founded by
the Siamese. It was organised after the manner of
the savings banks and proved to be very helpful to the
Christian community of Bangkok. He also persuaded
a small group of Christian Siamese to organise a
Steam Rice Milling Company on a Christian basis, no
work to be done on the Sabbath and a fixed portion
of the income to be devoted to Christian work.</p>

<p>Although Boon Itt had made himself felt among
the native Christians during the few years he had
spent in Bangkok directly after return to Siam, he
now came to be recognised and accepted as the leader
of the Siamese Christian Church. He did not aim to
be a leader; his intention was just to put himself
behind the work and help wherever he could. But
this very helpfulness caused the people to look up to
him with profound respect. They had appreciation
of his understanding of their needs, of his sympathy
with their aspirations, and of his ability to look at
things from their personal point of view. In a few
months his house had become the headquarters for
Siamese Christians on the east side of the river, and
little gatherings of friends were of frequent occurrence.
This gave him a personal influence that he
alone failed to perceive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<p>But scarcely had Boon Itt laid his hands to this
great task when within a year his labours came to a
sudden end. He fell a victim to cholera. After
telling of the sudden attack of the disease, Dr. Eakin
recounts the most impressive closing scenes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“We were with him until late in Friday night, and
left to return to the High School, telling them to call
us if there should be any change. The weather had
been hot and dry. No rain had fallen for about two
months. All animate nature seemed to be suffering and
longing for relief from the drought.</p>

<p>“About midnight we were called. As we went to
the house, we noticed that there was a change coming
in the weather. The wind was rising in fitful gusts,
and dark clouds were scudding across the sky.</p>

<p>“We found that he had passed away without returning
to consciousness. Soon after we entered the house,
the monsoon broke in torrents of rain. The house
shook under the fierce attacks of the raging tempest....
The bereaved wife calmly gathered the friends together
in the little sitting room, passed around the
hymn books among them and asked them all to sing.
Through the long hours of that terrible storm, they
sang those hymns of Christian faith and hope and comfort.
In the interval between these songs of the night,
they talked of the future. One expressed concern about
the finishing of the new church. (A part of his ebbing
strength Boon had spent in explaining the details of
the drawings he had made for the roof of the church.)
It would be difficult to find a contractor who would be
willing to take up the work that had fallen from a dead
hand, owing to a superstition that the building would
be haunted. Then Kru Thien Pow, head teacher in the
Boys’ High School and a most devoted friend of the
fallen chief, broke down and wept aloud: ‘I am not
thinking of the new church,’ he said, ‘some one will be
found to complete that work. I am thinking of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
Kingdom of Christ in Siam. Who will take the vacant
place in this service?’”</p>
</div>

<p>The death of Boon Itt occurred May 8, 1903. Besides
his widow, he left three children, Samuel Buntoon,
Eliza Brante and Phreida.</p>


<h3>AN APPRECIATION</h3>

<p>The death of Boon Itt caused inexpressible sorrow
and dismay among all who knew him, both in Siam
and America. It brought forth universal testimonies
of esteem for the man; friends seemed to vie with
each other in veneration of his memory. Almost
spontaneously there arose the suggestion to erect as a
memorial to him a building that would provide facilities
for the social work among young men which he
had inaugurated. Committees both in Siam and in
the United States met with cordial response to the
proposal. The Crown Prince esteemed it a pleasure
to make the first contribution for Siam towards the
proposed building, while members of the government
gladly participated in the fund. The king of Siam,
who was absent at the time, expressed his intention to
assist when he learned of the project after his return.</p>

<p>Prince Damrong, Minister of the Interior, when
invited to contribute to the fund, replied: “I am glad
to help in a memorial to that splendid man. You may
not know that I offered him a position which would
have led to high titles of nobility from the king of
Siam, to the governorship of a large province and to
a large increase of income. Yet he declined these
high honours and financial benefits that he might continue
in the service of Jesus Christ. Boon Itt was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
true Christian.” As a result of the movement, the
“Boon Itt Memorial Building” now stands as a visible
testimonial to all Bangkok in behalf of the noble
character of this Christian Siamese, and perpetuates
the heart’s desire of this servant of Christ for the
young men of Siam.</p>

<p>Boon Itt gave only ten rapid but full years to the
Gospel ministry for his countrymen, but he set in
motion spiritual influences that will persist many
times that brief decade. The marvel is that he laid
the foundations so deep in the hearts of the people
and built so lofty in their aspirations in so short a
time. Yet the higher achievement was not what he
did but rather the Christian character which, by the
grace of Jesus Christ, he developed in beautiful symmetry
and completeness. In his life the Spirit manifestly
bore its full fruition of “love, joy, peace,
longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
temperance.” But the unique significance of his life
lies neither in what he did nor what he was; rather
it lies in the notable demonstration that the religion
of Jesus Christ can take a man of any race or religion,
completely transform his mind and heart, engraft in
him the Christian culture, and yet leave him true to
his own people. His life is a testimony that the
Christian religion is a universal religion, for all races,
for all lands and for all ages.</p>
